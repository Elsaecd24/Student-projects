Moving forward, we willno longer benefit from this relief.Dividends received of £9m were £(59)m lower year-on-year dueto the removal of the annual dividend received from Tesco Bank,following the announcement of the planned sale of our existingbanking operations.

The Board and ExecutiveCommittee are responsible for the effectivemanagement of risk across the Group and wemanage our risks in line with the risk appetiteset by the Board.Risk management framework (RMF)The diagram below provides an overview of ourframework definingTesco’s riskmanagementprocess and governance. Our RMF continues tobe embedded throughout the organisation,enabling us to clearly identify, prioritise, respond,and monitor our most significant risks andemergingrisk themes.Our RMF supports decisionmaking, with culture and leadership being at theheart of our framework, including a clear tonefrom the top on the importance of riskmanagement.

We provide regular learningopportunities to strengthen our colleagueawareness on various risks and controls, forexample providing appropriate training to helpprevent cyber security incidents, as well ascommunicating the opportunities and safeguardswhile using artificial intelligence tools.Risk management frameworkPrincipal risks and uncertainties*In addition to the Group risk and compliance committee, there are other internal stakeholder risk committees (e.g. the cyberand privacy risk committee and theGroup planet committee).Principal risks are significant risks that could affect our strategic ambitions, future performance, viability, and/or reputation.Full disclosures of these risks is included on pages 32 to 37.GovernanceRisk processBoardAudit CommitteeGroup Chief Executive andExecutiveCommitteeGroup risk and compliancecommittee*Businessand functionalleadership teamTesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024Strategic report30.\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf21 ---\n","We are cognisant of the revised UK CorporateGovernance Code requirements set by the FRCand have appropriate plans in place.Risk identification and prioritisationA complete view of our risk universe starts withthe analysis of our business, the externalenvironment within which weoperate,theregulatory landscape and our internaloperations.This includes the impacts on our strategy,initiatives, governance and processes. We use aconsistent assessment criterion to identify andprioritise risks at the Group, business unit andfunctionallevel, alongwith horizon scanning foremergingrisk themes.The identified risks arecategorised into one or more of the following risktypes: strategic, change, operational, finance orcompliance. This enables effective governanceand monitoring of the risks.Management assessesthe riskson a continuousbasis, taking into account the risk to Tesco’sstrategy, our colleagues and our operations,as well as our impact on society and theenvironment. There is regular formal oversightthroughclearly defined governance structures,e.g. the cyber and privacy risk committeeoverseesthe various elements of cyber securityand data privacy risks.Risk controls and responsesFor risks where our risk appetite is low, we take arobustapproach todetermineappropriate riskcontrols and responses. For these risks (typicallyregulatory and compliance risks) we haveestablished policies and blueprints to guide thebusiness in managing the risks. These risks aremonitored formally by one or more of our variousgovernance bodies, such as our Group risk andcompliance committee, as well as by the AuditCommittee. For other risks, which are typicallystrategic, pervasive or dynamic in nature, the riskcontrols and responses are determined on acase-by-case basis in line with the strategic goalsof the organisation. Our approachto risk appetiteprovides the framework to consistently respondto risk and establish boundaries for coherent riskdecision making. This element of the riskmanagement framework hasbeen enhancedduring the current year to align the approach andadopt consistently. We will continue to improveand strengthen our risk appetite approach on acontinuous improvement basis.Governance,reporting andmonitoringA strong risk culture is at the heart of our RMFwith clear risk ownership and proactiveleadership. The responsibility for identifying,assessing, escalating and managing risks resideswith management at a functional, business unitand executive level. The Board has overallresponsibility forrisk managementand is activelyengaged in risk discussions. The Audit Committee,on behalfof the Board, undertakes an annualeffectiveness assessmentof the RMF, with regularfocus on specific emerging risks and a reviewacross all principal risks, twice a year, which alsosupports the external reporting process, seepage 87.

The Audit Committee reviews andapproves all changes to the audit plan andreceives regular updates on the outcome ofthe work performed. Furthermore, second-linefunctions, such as: finance controls; ethicsand compliance; and safety, systematicallytest key processes and controls establishedby management to mitigate risks.

However, the global foodsystem is one of the leading contributors to natureand biodiversity loss.With the food sector also responsible for morethan one third of global greenhouse gas (GHG)emissions, it is vital we play our part in protectingnature in at-risk landscapes including forests,fresh-water catchments and marineenvironments.At Tesco, protecting nature encompassesactionin our supply chains to reduce the impact that keyproducts and commodities have on our naturalworld, as well as landscape-level efforts toincrease biodiversity, manage water resourcesresponsibly and avoid polluting waterways, protectnatural habitats including peatland and improvesoil health. Given the interconnectedness betweenthe climate and nature crises and the central rolethat food production plays in both, we must strivefor a nature-led transition to net zero. Natureplays a prominent role across our planet plan,particularly under the protect nature pillar, wherewe will deliver much of our nature-related work.To achieve this, we have cross-identified keyactions that achieve significant outcomes forboth emissions reduction and nature protection.In managing the risk and resilience of our supplychains it is also important to simultaneouslyconsider the risks that climate change and natureloss pose to our supply chain resilience.

Theseinvestments are fully integrated into ourthree-year strategic plan and our annual budget.The strategic plan and the budget are bothreviewed and approved by the Board withreference to the capital and associated operatingcost investments required to deliver our carbonreduction commitments.The Group planet committee, chaired by our ChiefCommercial Officer who is the executive sponsorfor climate, provides strategic oversight and isresponsible for ensuring the delivery of all ourenvironmental sustainability targets.These includeinterim decarbonisation, climate risk managementand our climate-related disclosures. The Groupplanet committee meets quarterly and, alongsidethe Chair, comprises representativesfromsignificant business functions, which materiallyinfluence our ability to achieve our planet-relatedcommitments andregulatory obligations. Themeeting minutes are shared with our CorporateSecretariat, who then table further discussions atthe Board as required.Three steering groups underpin theimplementation and compliance component ofour planet governance structure and feed intothe planet committee. The group operationaldecarbonisation steering group is responsible fordelivering initiatives to meet our Scope 1 and 2targets. The planet steering group is responsiblefor delivering initiatives in our supply chain tomeet our Scope 3 targets. The ESG reporting &disclosure group operates under delegatedauthority from the Disclosure Committee andsupports a shared objective with the planetcommittee of robust and transparent externalreporting. The steering committees are morebroadly supported by several cooperativeworkstreams that each focus on carbonreduction within material emissions hotspotsacross the business.StrategyWe understand that our best strategy to mitigateour main physical and transition climate risks is tobecome a net zero business across the wholeGroup, entailing fast, large-scale, and effectivedecarbonisation of our operations and our supplychain. Therefore, in 2023 Tesco became one of thefirst companies globally to gain SBTi validation forour net zero targets on all greenhouse gasemissions, including those originating from forests,land and agriculture (FLAG) emissions, aligned witha 1.5°C pathway. Our targets include stretchinginterim commitments to reduce absolute Scope 1and 2 emissions from our own operations by 85%by 2030 from a 2015 baseline year, and a voluntarytarget to achieve net zero on Scopes 1 and 2 by2035, 15 years ahead of our SBTi validated target.To date, we have reduced our Scope 1 and 2emissions by 61% vs our 2015 baseline. On Scope 3,our target includes a 55% reduction by 2032 froma 2019baseline on emissions from energy andindustrial sources, and absolute Scope 3 emissionsfrom FLAG emissions by 39% by 2032 from a 2019baseline year. Ultimately, we will reach net zeroacross all scopes by 2050 via a reduction of 72% ofFLAG emissions, and 90% on Scope 3 non-FLAGemissions. Residual emissionswill be neutralised inline with the SBTi guidance.According to the strategic and rounded approachproposed inthe Transition Plan Taskforceframework, businesses should not only focus ontheir own net zero targets, they should also workon building adaptation and resilience to theeffects of climate change, and finally driveindustry system change. This transpires in the keyinitiatives described in our strategy below.Tesco’s planetagenda categoriseswork across sixdifferent areas and includes a number ofinitiatives as it works towards the targetsvalidated by the SBTi.Pages 18 and 19describethe planet plan in detail. Below is an overview ofthe main decarbonisation initiatives within the sixpillars of our planet plan, and progress to date.While our Scope 1 and 2 emissions may representa small proportion of our footprint, it is the areaover which we have full control and are therefore,with the right planning and capital allocation, ableto deliver at pace.Decarbonise transportTransport comprises around 40% of ouroperational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions. That is whywe are working to switch all our fleets tolow-carbon alternatives by 2035 where possiblebased on available market solutions. As part ofour EV100 pledge, we have deployed 571 electrichome delivery vans and are on track to be 100%electric by 2030. We continue to trial variousmodels across the UK and Central Europe as wellas electrical refrigeration units in our chillednetworkand bio-CNG trucks.Reduce store emissionsIn2020,wereachedour RE100 commitmentto100% renewable electricity 10 years ahead of our2030 target. We designed our strategy to ensurewe increasingly source our electricity directly viapower purchase agreements (PPAs), going beyondrenewable energy certificates to help boostdomestic renewable capacity in the markets weserve. We are committed to onsite and offsitedirect power deals supplying 60% of ourelectricity demand by 2030, and with thepartnerships already in place expect to generatearound a third of our UK electricity demand withinthe next 18 months. Addressing remaining storeemissions, we are switching away from ourdepreciated HFC refrigerant systems torecovered CO2systems. To replace gas boilers,we are trialling air source heat pumps and heatreclaim systems across the UK and Central Europe.Scope 3 represents over 98% of our groupemissions and we are therefore focused on howwe can drive and advocate for change to delivernet zero and build resilience along our value chain.Decarbonise agricultureAgriculture makes up around 39% (FLAGemissions as defined by the SBTi) of our wholefootprint, making it the single biggest contributorto our end-to-end value chain emissions. We aretaking awhole landscape,systems-basedapproach to supporting the sector’s transition,using common standards to drive better landmanagement practices and improve the overallresilience and productivity of our agri-foodsystems. For example, we are encouraging theshift to more sustainable agriculture by requiringall produce supplied to our UK stores to be LEAFMarque Certified by 2025, and supporting theadoption of similar standards for our meatsuppliers.

Financial incentives and long-termcontract options are animportant elementof oursustainable farming groups, giving our farmers theconfidence to plan and invest in their businessesto become low carbon.Halting deforestationDeforestation and conversion in animal feedsupply chains is a significant source of emissionsassociated with sourcing our products. We willapply the upcoming EU and UK due diligencelegislation across the Group to obtain thetransparency we need to verify our supply chainsas deforestation-free. Simultaneously, we areworking towards our voluntary target as asignatory to the UK Soy Manifesto which goesbeyond legislation to exclude conversion from ourown brand supply chains by December 2025.Suppliers setting science based targetsReaching net zero will require industry-wideefforts and shared accountability right throughthe supply chain, so we are working with oursuppliers to help and encourage them set theirown climate targets. To support our strategicambition, we have asked all UK suppliers to set anSBTi-aligned net zero target and to beginmeasuring and reporting their carbon footprint.Working with our suppliers to reduce wasteOn-farm food loss represents over 25% of theUK’s total food loss and waste. Tackling foodwaste can deliver benefits across the supplychain, through more efficient operations. Wehave launched Tesco Exchange, an onlinemarketplace that matches suppliers who havetoo much of a product, for example crops,by-products, ingredients or packaging, with otherTesco suppliers that need it. All Tesco suppliershave access to the Tesco Exchange. We alsomanage bumper crops at certain times of theyear through great value offers for ourcustomers. For example, in recent heatwavesthat generated surplus of warmer climateproduce, we sold kilo boxes of strawberries andcherries at a discounted price to customers.Healthy, sustainable dietsOne of the most impactful ways to reach a netzero food system is to shift demand towardsmore sustainable choices, including diverseproteins, fruit and vegetables. Our approach tohealthy sustainable diets is well established,seeking to make abetter-balanced diet easy,affordable, and enjoyable through actionsincluding product reformulation, promotions,pricing and strengthening of our plant-based andhealthier ranges. We are committed to leadingthe plant-based market with a competitive andcompelling range of meat and dairy alternatives.We have an innovation programme across thegroup which looks to identify and scale futurehealthy andsustainable ingredients andprocesses.This workincludes global innovationand technology scanning, working with ourestablishedsupplier partners, business tobusiness ingredient suppliers and new suppliers.We offer great value fruit and veg across all ourcore value propositions, including Aldi PriceMatch, Fresh 5 and Clubcard Prices. Our ‘BetterBaskets’ campaign is designed to help and inspirecustomers to make healthier and moresustainable choices. We have learnt thatcustomers respond to helpful nudges at point ofpurchase, so we have created Better Basketzones in stores and online which signpost betterchoices.Protect natureIt is important to consider the risks that climatechange and nature loss simultaneously pose toour supply chain resilience, as we recognise theinterconnectedness between nature and climate.At Tesco, protecting nature encompasseslandscape-level efforts toincrease biodiversity,manage water resources responsibly and avoidpolluting waterways, protect natural habitats,including peatland, and improve soil health. Findout more about the work we are doing on natureonpage38.While we are confident the above plan will help ustransition to net zero, we remain exposed tophysical and transition risks driven by theescalating climate crisis. We continue to workwith the climate analytics company Risilience tomodel our climate-related risks andopportunities. Built using the latest scientificresearch and geopolitical evolutions in fivewarming scenarios, the Risilience modelling hasenabled us to develop a complete picture using arepresentative sample of Tesco’s products andorigin countries, as well as locations of Tesco-owned facilities and financial information.The tables overleaf summarise the financial valueat risk associated with three material transitionrisk categories (policy, consumer and technology)and one physical risk (raw materials supply) overthe short term (five years) and medium term (10years) and a qualitative assessment of how theserisks could evolve over the longer term (20 years).These time periods have been selected so thatthe five-year, short-term view can inform ourinternal financial planning process, 10-yearenables a view of how transitional risks andopportunities develop and 20 years captures theevolution ofphysical risk.The five warming scenarios modelled were for>4°C, 3°C, 2.5°C, 2°C and 1.5°C pathways. Thesepathways are based on the IPCC’s SharedSocioeconomic Pathways and allow Tesco toassess a wide range of climate possibilities. Thedisclosedimpacts are quoted based on a1.5°Cpathway, aligned to the Paris Agreement andTesco’s stated targets, and a 3°C pathway alignedto the current warming pathway as reported bythe IPCC, to ensure we cover the range ofpossible evolutions. We have quoted the costs orfinancial value at risk below as a range, reflectingthe uncertainties of climate-related modellingand our resulting reliance on assumptions. Unlessstated, our modelling assumes just the downsiderisk, using our current product range, sourcingand asset base with no mitigation or strategicresponse to minimise the risk. We continue toreview and refine our modelling in line withemergingtrends. More details of keyassumptionsare included for each risk below.Did you know:In 2023, Tescobecame one of thefirst companiesglobally to gain SBTivalidationfor our netzero targets on allgreenhouse gasemissions,includingour Forest, Land andAgriculture emissions(FLAG), aligned witha 1.5°C pathway.Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 202441.Strategic reportGovernanceFinancial statementsAdditional information\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf2c ---\n","TCFD continuedPolicyriskPathwayMitigated annual impactfive-year outlookMitigated annual impactten-year outlook20-year outlook3°CNot materialNot materialCarbon prices remain at current levels or rise marginally,with an inconsistentglobal approach, which leads tominimal financial impact to our business1.5°C£50–100m£100–150mCarbon prices begin to plateau and are sustained at thislevel, with further adoption across the developed anddevelopingeconomiesThe policy risk models an increase in future carbon pricing which would largely impact the prices we pay our suppliers for theproducts wesell to customers. Under a 3°C pathway,we assume no change to the current carbon taxation system which has generated a non-materialoutput, while the 1.5°C pathway models wide-spread adoption of increasing rates of carbon taxation. The model assumes a reduction inour emissions footprint, aligned to our net zero plan, and we have assumed that the majority of the financial risk would be mitigated bymeans of shifts in consumer behaviour and general market pricing.Our assumption for the 1.5°C pathway over the longer term would be for carbon pricing to eventually plateau, while for the 3°Cpathwaywe would expect the currently low levels of global carbon prices to remain stable, with inconsistent global adoption and thereforeimmaterial financial impact.Consumer market riskPathwayUnmitigated annual impactfive-year outlookUnmitigated annual impactten-year outlook20-year outlook3°CNot materialNot materialConventionalshopping preferences continue, withexistinglevelsof uptake for sustainable optionscontinuing, resultingin only a minor impact to our current business1.5°C£50–100m£50–100mDemand forsustainable products and service becomesmainstream in the market, the purchasing behaviours andassociated financial risk seen in the five and ten-yearhorizon stabilise over a longer time period rather thanincreasing in a linear fashionThis risk models the impact of customers’ sustainable purchasing decisions, for example placing a greater importance on theenvironmental impact when purchasing new clothes. The modelling assumes no benefit from switching to more sustainable productsandis based on our current product category sales participation.The modelling found the levels of financial risk in our core food business to be negligible, due to our proven ability to adaptour productoffer to meet changing consumer demands and the existing high levels of substitutability available to customers by means of ourbroadplant-based and dairy-alternative product ranges. Our modelling of consumer preference changes allows our product development andbuying teams towork with oursupplier partners toevolve ourproduct ranges to remain at the forefrontof emerging customerbehavioursand demands.We have seen a significant increase in the risk value for the 1.5°C pathway year-on-year. The updated modelling now asserts that a faster,greater increase in sustainable consumer purchasing decisions is required to align to the 1.5°C pathway.

The 1.5°Cpathway assumes a faster-paced transition to green technology whereas as our 3°C pathway assumes a much slower transition. Themodelling uses the current net book value of our asset base, with no mitigation or planned transition of our current asset base.Risk levels for both pathways remain low even with no mitigation activity considered. Our mitigation plan for this risk is to continue to maintainboth short and long-term investment plans with a clear connection between these plans and our sustainability targets and commitments.Over the medium term in our 1.5°C pathway, we would expect green technology uptake to continue to grow and in the long term mostnon-green technology to have been phased out, whereas in our 3°C scenario green technology uptake will continue to grow, but carbon-based technologies remain in use.The Group’s three-year strategic plan integrates the delivery of our sustainability ambitions, of which the decarbonisation ofour ownoperationsis the most material interms ofdirect capital requirement.The strategicplan is reviewed and approved by the Board annually,including a review of the key decarbonisation initiatives and associated costs and capital investments. Our review process forproposedcapital investments ensures we understand how different projects will impact our emissions levels. This enables us to balance the bestcarbon return forour investment, considering thematurity of emerging technologies and supplycapacity.

This riskwas assessedto be immaterial in our prior year disclosure, broadening the commodities modelled during this year has generated a more materialoutput ofthis risk.Risk levels remain relatively low for both pathways, with or without mitigation activity considered. This reflects that our grower base isalready geographically diverse, offering a natural hedge to changing climate conditions in specific locations.We are building climate change risk into our resilience planning, informed by our modelling with Risilience and led by our commoditiesteam. We recognise that the impacts of climate change that we are already experiencing, and to an extent are locked into from thedelayed effect of historic emissions, compels us to develop adaptive plans in our sourcing strategy to protect availability andquality.This includes ensuring a diverse supplier base both locally and internationally. The next phase of our sustainable agricultureplans is tostart embedding sustainability into our product offering for customers, bringing our work to life in stores.Did you know:In February 2024, ourlatest windfarm,inpartnership with EDFRenewables,WestBenhar, located in theScottish Highlands,started generatingrenewable electricity.It willgenerate asubstantial30.1MW,producing enoughclean energy topower the equivalentof 18,000 homesper year.In addition to the risks above, a further threetransition risks and two physical risks weremodelled which we have not disclosed.The transition risks assessed but not disclosedinclude: the risk of climate-related litigation, therisk of a negative shift in consumer sentiment;and negative investor sentiment due to aperceived lack of action to address climatechange. We have chosen not to provide furtherdetailed disclosure of these risks because webelieve that our sustainability commitments andprogress made to date are both well understood,and ourongoing engagementacross ourdifferentstakeholder groups enables us to stay alignedwith changing expectations in this fast-developingspace. This includes our significant investment inthe decarbonisation of our property estate andtransport fleet, our market-leading sustainableproduct ranges, and the provision of the largestelectric vehicle (EV) charging network of anyUK supermarket.The two physical risks we have modelled butchosen not to disclose are the resilience of ourbusiness facilities to climate impacts and marketdemand disruption driven bychanging weather.The geographically diverse nature of our storeand distribution network provides a degree ofstructural resilience. Furthermore, our enhancedmodellingcapabilities allowus to anticipateandmanage the potential physical climate risks at asite level, for example devising flood plans at siteswith high risk of flooding. As a result, while someindividual locations will be more exposed toadverse climate impacts than others, thefinancial value at risk is not material eitherindividually or aggregated and has therefore notbeen disclosed.OpportunitiesAs the impacts of climate change escalate, wewitness increasing negativeimpacts oncommunities. Therefore, our efforts focus onunderstanding and mitigating the risks to ourbusinessand stakeholders. However, werecognise risk mitigation can unlock some positiveoutcomes, for example:—Lower impact ranges: shifting consumers dietsis unlocking growth in new product ranges,including alternative proteins, legumes, pulses,fruits and vegetables. As a retailer, Tesco canexpand its plant-based ranges to cater toconsumerdemand, and thusmitigate someofthe risks due to consumption habits changing.—Resource efficiency: lowering emissionsintensity within our operations and supplychain via efficient energy solutions such asrefrigeration and heating systems in ourstores, can unlock energy savings and thusfinancial savings.—Electric vehicle charging offering forcustomers: Tesco is uniquely placed to bethe most convenient place for customersto charge at while they shop.—Accessto less volatile energy prices byincreasingly procuring energy forstores viaour onsite and offsite long-term PPAs.Risk managementFollowing the establishment of climate change asa standalone principal risk in 2020/21, reviewshave been conducted at various levels includingthe Executive Committee and the Board.

The plan delivers the Group’s purpose of‘serving our customers, communities and planeta little better every day’ and is underpinned by aclear strategic focus on creating sustainable,long-term value for every Tesco stakeholder.The Group conducts an annual strategic planningprocess, comprising a comprehensivereassessment of progress against the Group’sstrategic objectives, alongside an evaluation of thelonger-term opportunities and risks in eachmarket in which the Group operates. The processforidentifying the principal and emergingrisks ineach market is an important input to this process.The Group’s strategicplan and viability statementare both considered over a three-year period, asthis time horizon most appropriately reflects thedynamic andchanging retail environment in whichthe Group operates.Long-term planning processThe long-term planning process builds from theGroup’s current position and considers theevolution of the strategic objectivesover the nextthree years. Three years is selected as theGroup’s planning horizon and viability periodbased on the pace of change in both thecompetitive landscape and customer shoppingbehaviourswithin the retail sector.Current positionOur multi-year performanceframework, strategicdrivers andcapital allocation framework, whichwere introduced in 2021, continue to guidemanagement’s actions. Themulti-yearperformance framework sets out the objectivesof the business: to drive top-line growth; to growabsolute profits while maintaining sector leadingmargins; and to generate stable retail free cashflow each year. The delivery of these objectiveswill enable the Group to maintain a strongbalance sheet, invest for growth and deliverimproved returns for shareholders.Over the past two years, many of our customershave faced significant disposable incomepressures due to the rising cost of living, asoverall marketinflation rose sharply.Managementhave focused on supporting customers throughthis time by continuing to offer great value, qualityand customer service,while deliveringsustainable growth, supported by:—A strategic focus on driving growth andcontinued focus on cost reduction fromsimplification of the operating model;—A clear set of financial priorities to delivercash profit, free cash flow and earnings pershare growth, underpinned by a robust capitalallocation framework; and—A diversified business portfolio covering retail,wholesale,insurance, money services anddata science.Refer to the Group Chief Executive’s review frompage 9and the Financial review onpages 22 to29for further detail regarding the Group’sstrategicand financial progress.Longer-term prospectsThe following factors are considered both in theformulation of the Group’s strategic plan, and inthe longer-term assessment of the Group’sprospects:—The principal risks and uncertainties faced bythe Group, as well as emerging risks as they areidentified, and the Group’s response to these;—The prevailing economic climate and globaleconomy, competitor activity, marketdynamics and changing customerbehaviours;—Any structural changes in how customersshop, additional costs incurred by the Groupand potential macroeconomic consequencesof inflation due to geopolitical events andglobal supplychallenges;—Opportunities for further cost reductionthrough operational simplification andleveraging technology; and—The resilience afforded by the Group’soperational scale.Assessing the Group’s viabilityThe viability of the Group has been assessed,considering the Group’s current financialposition, including external funding in place overthe assessment period, and after modelling theimpact of certain scenariosarising from theGroup’s principal risks outlined onpages 30 to 37.Three ‘severe but plausible’ scenarios have beenmodelled which address the principal risks thatthe Group has assessed would have the mostdirect and material impact on the Group. In thisyear’s assessment, we have combined scenariosconsidering supply chainand customerimpactsto create a more comprehensive scenario whichincludes the impact these areas have on eachother. None of themodelled scenarios, eitherindividuallyor in aggregate, threaten the viabilityof the Group. The hypothetical scenariosdescribed are also used as the basis for therisk-weighted cash flows which are included inour impairment of non-current asset sensitivityanalysis.

The Group absorbs elevated levels of cost inflationacrossgoods purchased forsale to customers and theoperatingcost base,particularly in costs related to colleague payroll. The ability of the Group tomanage these costtensionsthrough cost savings is constrained. Managementhave applied a downside scenario which assumes the Group absorbs furthercost inflation in colleague pay and cost of goods sold. UK interest rates remainhigher than currently forecasted as central banks seek to reduce the headlinerateof inflation. Consumerconfidence worsens, limiting volume growthopportunity as consumers continue to be mindful of discretionary spending.Management have applied adownside scenariowhich reducesthe projectedlike-for-like sales growth in each of the three years of the Group strategicplan by c.(2)%. Options to offset cost increases through retail prices areconstrained and competition within the grocery sector intensifies in a bid forprice leadership, requiring incremental priceinvestment.Data breach—Cyber security—Political, regulatoryandcompliance—Customer—DataprivacyThe volume and nature of the customer and supplier data we hold as abusiness could result in a serious data or security breach which sees asignificant financial penalty levied against the Group, aligned to the UK GDPRpenalty framework which could see a maximum fine levied of 4% of Grouprevenue. For the purposes of this stress test, management have included afine quantified as 2% of Group revenue, being the mid-point of the potentialmaximum fine. A significant data breach poses a reputational risk, resulting ina declinein customersentiment and anadverse trading impact. The extentofthis trading impact is very uncertain, both in terms of the financial impact andthe period it may take to recover customer trust. As such, the potential brandreputationelement of this scenario has been modelledvia a ‘reverse stresstest’. This assesses the risk in the context of the residual headroom after allother scenarios have been applied.The resultantlike-for-likesales declinewhich would have to occur to eliminate the residual cash headroom, includingall other scenarios happening in aggregate, is significantly higher than anydecline the Group has faced in recent history.Climate change—Climatechange—Geopolitics and other globalevents—Security of supply—Responsible sourcing—Regulatory and compliance—CustomerRising global temperatures result in an increasing incidence and severity ofextreme weather events, leading to a higher incidence of store closures dueto flooding and disruption to our global supply chain. The quantification of thepotential financial impactsof physical and transitionalrisks and opportunitieslinked to climate change on the Group have been taken from our ongoingclimate-related risk modelling work based on 1.5°C warming pathway.We expect to be able to refinance external debt and renew committed facilities as they become due, which is the assumption madeinthe viability scenario modelling. Our committed facilities remain undrawn as at the end of the financial year. Please refer toNote32onpage 199 and 200for further details on our debt profile, including maturity dates. The scenarios above are hypothetical and purposefullysevere with the aim of creating outcomes that could threaten the viability of the Group. Certain mitigations have been appliedwithin thescenarios to offset the modelled liquidity impacts, including lower tax and bonus payments and a reduction in planned shareholderreturns. In the case of the modelled scenarios arising, additional mitigations are available to the Group to maintain liquidityto continue inoperation, such as: (i) accessing new external funding early; (ii) short-term cost reduction actions; and (iii) reducing capital expenditure.None of these mitigating actions are assumed in our current scenario modelling.Viability statementBased on these severe but plausible scenarios, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company will continue in operationand meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three-year period considered.This Strategic report (on pages 01 to 47 and incorporating by reference pages 64 and 65 and pages 70 to 72) has been prepared inaccordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, and has been approved and signed on behalf of the Board.Robert WelchGroup Company Secretary9 April 2024Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024Strategic report47.GovernanceFinancial statementsAdditional information\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf32 ---\n","Corporate governance reportGovernanceataglance.ContentsGovernance at a glance48Governance introduction50Board of Directors52Executive Committee57Governance framework58Purpose, values and culture62Board insights:s172 statement, Board activity,Board leadership in action64Understandingour stakeholders70Board performance73Nominationsand Governance Committee74Sustainability Committee78Audit Committee82Directors’ remuneration report90Directors’ report115Additional Directors’ report disclosures228This corporate governance reportdemonstrates some key themesthat are important to the Board:—Living our purpose through our valuesandbehaviourscreating ahealthy culture.—Having an effective corporate governanceframework supporting the Board in thedelivery of the Group’s objectives.—Delivering on our strategy while balancingthe interests of our stakeholders.Board highlights – key activities in 2023/24Board succession planningAppointment of a new Chair, planningfor Senior IndependentDirectorsuccession andCommittee succession.Key focus during 2023/2422% Purpose and strategy20% Operationalperformance19% Financial performance, riskmanagement and internal control21%Stakeholders18% Governance and cultureScrutiny of operationaland financialperformanceManagement reporting scrutinised at each Board meetingwith deepdives into financial and risk matters by the Audit Committee.Further developmentof sustainability strategyReview of key milestonesand operational capital expenditurerequired to achieve our net zero targets.Return of capitalOngoing share buyback programme, building on the ongoing capitalreturn programme launched in October 2021.

There havebeen a number of changes to the Board during the year. At the 2023AGM, John Allan stepped down from his role as Chair and Director ofthe Company. John made a significant contribution during his eightyears in the business and the Committee would like to thank him forhis strong stewardship. John Allan was appointed in 2015 and histenure as Chair was due to end in early 2024. A succession processhad started in early 2023 to identify his successor and theappointment of Gerry Murphy as Chair was announced on 3 July2023. John Allan had no involvement in the appointment of hissuccessor. Lindsey Pownall also stood down from the Board at the2023 AGM. Lindsey had served more than seven years on the Boardand had advised of her intention to retire in February2023.In September 2023, the Board welcomed Gerry Murphy as Chair ofthe Board. This followed an in-depth selection process, assisted byLygon Group, who has no connection to Tesco or any of itsdirectors. A succession committee was established by the Board inFebruary 2023, led by the Senior Independent Director andmembers of the Committee, supported by the Group CompanySecretary and Chief People Officer. Open advertising was not used.Monthly progress updates to the Board, led by Byron Grote, wereprovided throughout the process without the Chair being present.The Committee made a unanimous decision in July 2023 torecommend to the Board the appointment of Gerry Murphy. TheBoard and Committee believed that his significant business andboard level experience and deep understanding of corporategovernance, enabled him to provide the Board with valuableleadership in the delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives. Atimeline of the selection process undertaken is set out as follows.Spotlight on:Directors’ induction programme.The induction programme constantly evolves, changingas appropriate to reflect the business priorities, theexperience and expertise of the inductee and the rolethey will perform. For example, an individual to be appointedto the Remuneration Committee would have additionalmeetings with senior members of the Reward team andthe remuneration advisors; those joining the AuditCommittee, would have a more detailed finance andaudit programme and a non-executive director joiningSustainability Committee, would have additional meetingswith the Product, Environment and Group Communicationsteams. The programme has evolved over time, culminatingin a combination of senior management and advisormeetings, site visits and a library of documents, overa six-month period.Since joining the Board of Tesco PLC, I have had theopportunity, through a comprehensive and tailoredinduction programme, to meet members of theExecutive Committee and senior management acrossthe business and have undertaken a number of sitevisits across the different store formats, urbanfulfilment centres and distribution centres.

Upon appointment, Non-executive Directorletters of appointment stipulate the expected time commitmentwhile acknowledging that this may vary depending upon thedemands of the business and other events. The Committeeregularly assesses the other time commitments of Directors toensure that each Non-executive Director continues to havesufficient time to devote to their role. This assessment takes intoaccount the number and nature of the external commitments eachDirector has. It considers whether each Director has demonstratedthey have sufficient time to devote to their present role withinTesco, including under potential periods of corporate stress.Where cross-directorships exist, this does not affect theassessmenton independence. Each Directorcompletes aself-assessment of the time spent on their external commitmentswhich supports the Committee in their assessment. All Directorsmake themselves freely available as required, even at short notice,in order to meet the needs of the business. The Board is currentlysatisfied that the number of appointments held by each Directorin addition to their position with Tesco is appropriate to allow themto fulfil their obligations to Tesco.The Non-executive Directors provide a strong independentelement to the Board and a solid foundation for good corporategovernance, fulfilling the vital role of corporate accountability. TheCommittee formally reviews the independence of each of theNon-executive Directors at least annually. In assessing eachDirector’s independence, the Committee concluded that eachprovidesobjective challenge, strategic guidance, holdsmanagement to account and is willing to stand up and defend theirown beliefs and that each Non-executive Director continues to beindependent incharacter andjudgement in line with the definitionset out in the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018.In accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and the Company’sArticles of Association, Directors are required to report actual orpotential conflicts of interest to the Board for consideration and, ifappropriate, authorisation. If such conflicts exist, Directors excusethemselves from consideration of the relevant matter. On behalf ofthe Board, the Committee reviews the register of authorisedconflicts of interests at least annually to confirm its ongoingauthorisation of any potential or actual conflicts arising from aDirector’s interest. During the period, in reviewing the cumulativeconflicts of interests of each of the Directors, the Committeeconcluded that no Director had a conflict that would have adetrimentalimpact on theirindependence and judgementor theirtime commitment to Tesco.The Committee also carries out a rigorous review of performancewhen a Non-executive Director reaches three-years’ and six-years’service taking into account the Director’s commitment,contribution and effectiveness. During the year, a review of StewartGilliland, who reached his six-years’ service in March 2024, wasundertaken. Following a robust assessment, the Committeedetermined that Stewart should continue as a Director.Following a review of each of the Independent Non-executiveDirectors’ time commitment, contribution and effectiveness, theCommittee considered and recommended to the Board that each ofthe Directors be proposed for election or re-election byshareholders at the 2024 AGM, with the exception of Byron Grotewho will retire at the conclusion of the 2024 AGM.Non-executive Director external appointments aredetailedonpages 52 to 54.Senior management talent planningThe Board recognises the need to create conditions that fostertalent andencourage all colleaguesto achieve their full careerpotential. During the year, the Board has placed greater emphasison talentmanagement, diversity, equity and inclusion. TheCommittee strongly believes that diversity and providing aninclusive culture is a key driver of business success and theCommittee is committed to having a diverse and inclusiveleadership team which provides a range of perspectives, insightsand critical challenge needed tosupport good decision-making,helpingwith risk management, strategic planning and delivery.Succession planning atexecutive and senior management levelcontinues to be a priority for the Committee and throughout theyear, the Committee monitored the future leadership pipeline andthe available pool of talent in the Group. This is essential toensuring a continuouslevel ofquality in management,avoidinginstability by helping mitigate the risks which may be associatedwith unforeseen events, such as the departure of a key individual.The Committee’s review included a reviewof talent management,key role profiles and succession planning all through a lens ofdiversity,equity and inclusion.Diversity, equity and inclusionThe Board has a duty to ensure that any barriers are removedwhich might prevent a fair and equal workplace. Equity ensures thateveryone is treated fairly. All colleagues should feel comfortable toattend work as their authentic self. We have a clear diversity, equityand inclusion strategy in place to ensure that at Tesco, everyone’swelcome. Our diversity, equity and inclusion strategy is built onthree core pillars:We leadandrole-modelinclusionWe embedinclusion ineverything we doWe listen,learn andactThe Committee reviews progress against the diversity, equity andinclusion strategy twice a year.

Our UK colleague networks are Armed Forces,Disability, LGBTQ+, Parents and Carers, Race and Ethnicity andGender Equality. Other markets have variations of these networks.The Board’s diversity, equity and inclusion policy sits alongsidevarious other policies that support the Group’s wider commitmentto building an increasinglydiverse business where all colleagues aregiven equal opportunities through recruitment, learning anddevelopment. The Committee reviews the policy in detail each yearand monitors progress against it. During the year, the policy wasupdated to reflect the new recommendations set out in the ParkerReview to set ethnicity targets at senior management level.

Our commitment to operatingin a responsible and sustainable way reflects our beliefs and values.We know that our business depends on the world around us and as amajor retailer, we know we can make a big difference, transformingour own operations and working with suppliers, partners andstakeholdersto decarbonise our supply chain.Committee site visits were conducted during the year to supportthe oversight of Tesco’s sustainability activities. These allowed usto see the impact that our sustainability initiatives have on ourcolleagues, customers and communities, alongside opportunitiesto further drive change.Details of the Committee’s store visit, which focused on the keyactivities that support the planet plan pillars across food andwider store operations, can be found onpage 69.The Committee’s Groundwork visit to a community projectis detailed onpage 80.In August 2023, Tesco became one of the first companies globallyto set validated science-based targetson all greenhouse gasemissions, including those originating from forests, land andagriculture (FLAG) emissions. Ournet zero science-based targetshave been validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi),the body that validates our climate targets. The validated targetswill see us work towards our commitment to become carbonneutral across our own operations by 2035, and through the valuechain by 2050, inline with the Paris Agreement’s aim oflimitingglobal temperature rise to 1.5°C.How the Committee has discharged itsresponsibilitiesDuring the year, the Committee’s principal activities were as follows:Sustainability strategyDuring the year, our planet plan has provided a clear path on theoversight of the important initiatives to deliver our climate goals, withactivities grouped into six pillars as set out onpages 18 and 19.The Committee takes regular deep dives into each pillar to betterunderstand the opportunities and challenges to achieve ourtargets.

Management engaged with each of the firms to supportpreparations fortheir formaltender proposals. Corporateinformation – detailing structure, principal activities andpolicies, were shared through a data room which allparticipating firms could access. A structured Q&A processwas implemented to provide clarification and additionalinformation, which was shared with all firms.The initial group reduced to two firms who took part in the fulltender process. The remaining firms withdrew autonomouslyfrom the audit tender process by reason of lack of capabilityand capacity to undertake an audit of the size and complexityof Tesco, and potential conflict. Management held discussionswith audit firms to understand why they felt unable to tenderand whether any changes to the audit parameters wererequired. The Committee was satisfied that the audit tenderexercise had been undertaken in a genuine manner, withrecognition that where possible audit work should be dividedamong challenger firms.

The framework will enhance theGroup'srisk culture and enable risk-informed decision-making forall business operations within the acceptable appetite position.Group Risk and AuditA new Chief Audit and Risk Officer was appointed in April 2023.The Committee monitors the activity, role and effectiveness of theGroup Risk and Audit function, as detailed across the page. At eachmeeting, the Committee received updates covering a range ofmanagement issues, including periodic reviews ofthe employmentof former auditor employees and non-audit services policies, theGroup’s audit charter and the audit plan.Group AuditGroup Audit is part of the Group Risk and Audit function. It reportsdirectly to the Committee and administratively to the Chief FinancialOfficer, with a remit to provide independent and objective assuranceover the Group’s prioritised risks and management structures. Itspurpose, authority and responsibilities are defined in the Group AuditCharter, which is reviewed and approved annually by the Committee.Group Audit’s activity is primarily driven by the annual internal auditplan which is reviewed and approved by the Committee. The plan isaligned to the Group’s principal risks and focuses on the biggest riskareas and strategic drivers. The internal audit plan remains underreview and subject to change throughout the year to reflect anychanges in risk profile, business objectives and the externalenvironment. The Committee reviews and approves all changesto the audit plan and receives regular updates on the outcomeof the work performed. In the coming year, the plan will covertechnology and cyber, including audits of second line assuranceteams and sustainability assurance.Beyond the audit plan, Group Audit also undertakes several otherassurance activities including continuous programme controlsreviews, pre-and/or post-implementation audits, advisory reviews,and othermanagement requested assurance. Theresults ofthesereviews are also presented and reviewed by the Committee. The2023/24 audit plan and additional assurance activities undertaken byGroup Audit have been completed and reviewed by the Committee,which has also reviewed and approved the 2024/25 audit plan.Group Audit effectiveness reviewsIn line with the Group Audit Charter, the Committee’s terms ofreference and the recommendations of the Internal Audit Code ofPractice, the Committee conducted an annual assessment of theeffectiveness of Group Audit. Conducted by an independent thirdparty, the overall assessment concluded that Group Audit waseffective. The assessment highlighted the team’s level ofindependence, objectivity, and professionaljudgement. TheCommittee discussed areas for improvement including the provisionof greater assurance and coordination across second line functions,further development of specialist capabilities and businessknowledge, and leveraging technology and data to drive furtherimprovement. Periodic spotlights on levels of assurance andsustainability matters would be built into the audit plan. Havingconsidered the results of this assessment, as well as through ongoingreview and oversight of the assurance activities, the Committeewere satisfied with the effectiveness of Group Audit.Internal controlsManagement is responsiblefor identifying and managing risks,andfor maintaining a sound system of internal control. The internalcontrol framework is intended to effectively manage rather thaneliminate the risk of failure to achieve the Group's businessobjectives. It can only provide reasonable, but not absolute,assuranceagainst the riskof material misstatement or financialloss.The key elements of the Group’s internal controlframeworkare monitored throughout the year and the Committee hasconducted a review of the effectiveness of the Group’s riskmanagement andinternal control systemson behalf ofthe Board.The Committee’s review of the effectiveness of internal controlshas encompassed a review of various reports provided bymanagement, GroupControl andCompliance,Group Risk, GroupAudit and External Audit. Annually, the Committee reviews theGroup Treasury Policy which contains a framework and approachto managing treasury risks. The Committee also receives riskmanagement updates from various areas of the business includingpensions and Tesco Bank. Further information on the riskmanagement process undertakenis included onpage 30. The ICFRframework is currently being enhanced to meet the future needs ofpending corporate governance reforms. The frameworkis underpinned by threepillarswhich will form our annual Codedeclaration from 2026/27, the pillarsbeing:entity level controls,business process controls and IT general controls. A key financialcontrols framework is maintained and used as the basis for focusedsecond-line control activities, as well as forming the foundation ofthe enhanced ICFR requirements. Greater rigour aroundcontrolstestingperformed in theyear was implemented in anticipation ofproposed corporate governance reforms. No material gaps wereidentified and necessary remediations were taken. There remainsIT general controls operating effectiveness testing to complete.To date, a significant proportion of controls are effective, withremediations in place to address deficiencies identified. In 2024,we will monitor progress against the remaining testing deficienciesand review the scope post completion of the Banking operationsdisposal and further embed the ICFR framework through acontinuous testing programme, training and building on ourcontrol community.Audit and Assurance PolicyThe Government had announced the corporate reform proposalsthat were expected to be enacted through secondary legislationwhich, among other matters, included the need for companies tocreate a formal audit and assurance policy (AAP) outlining theirstrategy for obtaining assurance on externally reported information.The proposals were withdrawn on 16 October 2023, however, Tescohas adopted a position to continue the development of an internalAAP and the Committee will continue to monitor this.87.Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024Financial statementsAdditional informationStrategic reportGovernance\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf5a ---\n","Corporate governance report continuedAudit Committee continuedExternal auditAt each meeting the Committee considers reports from theexternal auditor, Deloitte. These concern interim and year-endreports, audit plan, audit fees, auditor independence andnon-audit services, early warning reports, managementletterobservations and updateson ongoing audit work.As the Group’s external auditor for the 2023/24 financial year,Deloitte shared a further independent perspective on certainaspects of the Group’s financial control systems arising from itswork and reported both to the Board and the Committee.The Committee regularly reviews the role of the external auditorand the scope of its work. The Committee will consider future auditneeds as part of the AAP.Non-audit servicesThe FRC’s Revised Ethical Standard 2019 reduced the areas wherethe external auditor can provide non-audit services, such that onlycertain types of non-audit services that are closely related to anaudit or required by law or regulation can be provided. TheCommittee oversees the process for approving all non-audit workprovided by the external auditor to safeguard the objectivity andindependence of the auditor and comply with regulatory andethical guidance.

Among other factors, the review coversDeloitte’s independence, objectivity, appropriate mindset andprofessional scepticism. The Committee’s conclusions are based onits own observations and interactions with Deloitte and having regardto the Minimum Standard for Audit Committees.The Committee discussed feedback from the 2022/23 effectivenessreview and improvements incorporated intothe audit approach,which included enhanced testing and reliance on internal controls,greater use of technology and data analytics, and continuous insightsand improvements.The Committee recognised improvements in theprovision of data-driven insights and analysis in connection withIFRS 16 lease liabilities and right-of-use assets and revenue and costof sales areas of the audit.In January 2024, Deloitte’s effectiveness and quality was evaluatedon the basis of feedback provided through questionnaires completedby theBoard, management and business representatives. Facilitatedby an independent third party, the responses were collated andDeloitte was rated effective. The Committee discussed areas forimprovement to best meet the future needs of the Group, whichincluded greater insight of sustainability assurance, focusing oncontrols, looking forward to emergingissues, revised approachto thephasing of audit work i.e. bringing work forward to ease pressures inthe audit cycle and encouraging a more continuous audit process,addressing IT and cyber security controls, highlighting trends andthemes, and exploiting technology/digital tools. Deloitte had reviewedthe feedback and incorporated this into their audit approach toensure the audit would continue to evolve and enhance the auditeffectiveness. The Committee recommended to the Board thatDeloitte be reappointed at the 2024 AGM. The effectiveness ofDeloitte will be continually monitored in 2024/25 by the Committee.During theyear, managementfurther refined theirconsideration ofthe key judgements involved inthe impairment modelling, whichenabled Deloitte to focus on those areas most at risk of materialmisstatement. These areas were subject to audittesting earlier in theaudit cycle, thereby both simplifying and improving the efficiency ofthe impairment audit testing. Management also focused heavily onthe effectiveness of key financial controls over the impairmentprocess, which was tested by Deloitte as part of their audit. Finally,we note that management has further simplified the impairmentprocess on lower risk areas, enabling a more efficient identification ofimpairmentindicators and the focus of both managementandDeloitte to be on those areas where morejudgements and significantaccounting estimatesare required.Over the course of the year, the audit approach aligned with theevolution of the Group’s control environment and business strategy.Deloitte provided data-driveninsights andanalytics to managementand the Committee, as part of their risk assessment and testing of ITgeneral controls, and in their continued review of IFRS 16 leasebalances and calculation of discountrates.Deloitte was appointed at the AGM in June 2015 following theconclusion of a formal tender process for the statutory auditcontract.John Adamhasbeen leadauditpartnersince2020 andwillrotate as the lead partner following the 2024/25 financial year audit.The Committee worked closely with management to ensure that asuitable auditor onboarding process was in place. Richard Muschampwas identified as a proposed successor audit partner and led theDeloitte tender bid. Richard was interviewed by members of the AuditCommittee and senior management. Richard will assume the auditlead from April 2025 and will shadow John over the course of thecoming year in support of the transition.The Committee reviews and makes a recommendation to the Boardwith regard to the reappointment of the external auditor each year.In making this recommendation, the Committee monitored andassessed their effectiveness, overall auditquality, objectivity,independence, and lead partner rotation. The Committee monitoredcompliance with the Group’s policy on the employment of formerDeloitte employees and concluded the auditors remainedindependent. Based on the performance of the auditor and itsknowledge of the business, the Committee believes that it is in thebest interests of shareholders to continue to recommend Deloitte asthe external auditor.Committee membershipAll the Committee members are independent Non-executiveDirectors and the Board is satisfied that Byron Grote, Melissa Bethell,Caroline Silver and Karen Whitworth have significant, recent andrelevant financial experience.Additionally, ByronGrote, having held achief financial officer role for a significant period, and Caroline Silverand Karen Whitworth, as chartered accountants, are consideredsuitably qualified in accounting and/or auditing.

In light of these factors, theCommittee determined that no discretion should be applied toadjust the formulaic outturns and is satisfied that the remunerationpolicy has operated as intended.The Committee reviewed the grant price of the 2021 PSP (223.6p)compared to thegrant priceofthe2019 PSP(230.3p)and 2020PSP(227.2p) and was satisfied that no adjustments were required to theawards on grant for windfall gains. The Committee has againreviewed the position ahead of the vesting, taking into account theTesco share price as at 23 February 2024 of 279.7p and is satisfiedthat the increase in share price since grant is within the normalbounds and no windfall gains have occurred and that noadjustment is required on vesting.The chart below shows a breakdown of fixed and performance-based remuneration (excluding any buyout awards) paid to KenMurphy and Imran Nawaz in respect of 2023/24 and 2022/23. Asset out earlier, both individuals first participated in the PSP in 2021upon joining Tesco, with the payouts from these awards reflectedin the 2023/24 remuneration. As such, the significant year-on-yearincrease in remuneration primarily reflects the first vesting fromthese awards, which themselves reflect strongperformanceagainst stretching targets over a challenging period. The increasealso reflects share price growth of £0.9m for Ken Murphy and£0.4m for Imran Nawaz over the three-year performance period.Breakdown of remuneration (excluding buyout awards)FixedpayAnnual bonus payoutPSPpayout2023/242022/23£4.91m£1.64m£3.38m£9.93m£4.44m£1.71m£2.73m£2.27mKen Murphy2023/242022/23£2.33m£0.91m£1.71m£4.95m£0.91m£1.36mImran NawazLookingahead2024/25 salary and incentivesWhen considering base salary increasesfor oursenior executives,the Committee continues to be mindful of both the wider colleagueexperience and our fairness principles. Ken Murphy and ImranNawaz will receive base salary increases of 3.0% and 5.4% from26 May 2024, respectively. These are below the 9.1% increaseprovided to UK hourly-paid colleagues, who represent the vastmajority of the UK workforce. There will be no changes to theannual bonus and PSP performance measures or their weightings in2024/25 as the Committee continues to believe these areappropriate to incentivise the Executive Directors towards deliveryof the strategy.The Committee regularly reviews the overall remunerationpackages of the individual Executive Directors, as well as othersenior executives, to ensure that they are reflective of theirrespective roles and individual performance within Tesco. Withthese references in mind, when considering Imran Nawaz’s payopportunity, taking into account his impressive performance sincehis appointment and alongside his additional responsibilities, theCommittee determined that he will receive an increase in annualbonus from 225% to 250% of base salary and in the PSP from 250%to 275% of base salary from 2024/25. These increases are withinthe existing remuneration policy, which was approved by ourshareholders in 2022, and are set at the same levels we operatefor Ken Murphy.Corporate governance report continuedDirectors’ remuneration report continuedTesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 202492.Governance\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf5f ---\n","The Committee shared these proposals with 20 of our largestshareholders, representing circa 50% of the issued share capital,and proxy advisors who were overwhelmingly supportive of theproposedincreases.Further details of the operation of thesepay elements canbe found onpage 99.Continuation of progress in our sustainability journeyThe Committee recognises and supports the importance of aligningincentives with delivering our sustainability strategy. The currentin-flight PSP awards include carbon reduction, food wastereduction and ethnic and gender diversity measures, with targetsdirectly aligned to our sustainability commitments. The Committeeis particularly pleased to note the successful ethnic representationperformance to date, with the PSP target set for 2025 havingalready been achieved.In light of this, the Committee has carefully considered how toensure that our most material sustainability areas are aligned withremuneration going forward, while still being supported by robustand stretching targets. Following a review of the appropriateness ofthe existing sustainability measures, we continue to believe that themeasures used in 2022 and 2023 remain material to the Group andshould continue to be the measures in 2024, except that thegender target be extended to include senior managers. Thisreflects our long-term aim of achieving a gender equal workforce.Earlier in the year, we terminated our relationship with our foodwaste processor in the UK, following an internal review whichshowed that food, which we believed was being processed foranimal feed, was in fact going to anaerobic digestion. Whileanaerobic digestion can have a role in recovery of energy andavoids food going to landfill, we count food going to anaerobicdigestion as waste. Removing animal feed from our reportednumbers for 2022/23 resulted in a food waste reduction of 18%against our 2016/17 baseline, significantly lower than the 45%reduction reported in last year’s Directors’ remunerationreport.The donation of unsold food to community groups and sharedwith colleagues through the colleague shop in the UK are bothunaffected, as is the progress we are making to halve food wasteeverywhere in the Group. Following the termination of therelationship, the food waste reduction against our 2016/17baseline for the last two months of 2023/24 is 14%. After carefulconsideration, we have decided to retain our ambitious targetof achieving a 50% reduction and setting threshold and stretchtargets of 45% and 52% in respect of the 2024 PSP. Given theupdated view, it is unlikely either the 2022 or 2023 PSP wastereduction threshold targets will be met.Further details of our sustainability measures and how they linkto purpose and strategy are set out onpage 95.Board and Committee changesAs announced in May 2023, John Allan stepped down from his roleas Chair of the Board and a Committee member at the AGM on16 June 2023. Lindsey Pownall also stepped down from the Boardand the Committee at that AGM. I would like to thank bothJohn and Lindsey for their valuable contributions and willingness toprovide constructive solutions. Both received pro-rated fees up toand including 16 June 2023. No other remuneration payment wasmade by the Company to either John or Lindsey after ceasing tobe Non-executive Directors nor any payment for loss of office.Byron Grote served as interim Chair, Stewart Gilliland as interimSenior Independent Director and Karen Whitworth as interim AuditCommittee Chair from 16 June 2023 until 31 August 2023. Theyreceived no additional remuneration for these roles. Following arigorous search process, Gerry Murphy was appointed as our Chairfrom 1 September 2023. Gerry receives a Chair fee of £705,000,which is consistent with the fee received by the former Chair andfully aligned with the remuneration policy. Gerry is a chair ofexceptional calibre, with extensive global leadership experience inboth executive and non-executive roles, and I am thrilled he wasappointed to succeed John.We were delighted to welcome Carolyn Fairbairn to the Board andas a Committee member in September 2023. Carolyn brings awealth of experience and insights to the Committee. Recognisingthe importance of having the Audit Committee Chair as a memberof the Committee, following Byron Grote stepping down from theBoard and the Committee at the 2024 AGM, Karen Whitworth willjoin the Committee at this time.Further details on the Board Chair and Non-executive Director feescan be found onpages 110 and 111.Remuneration policy reviewThe current remuneration policy will expire at the 2025 AGM. TheCommittee will therefore undertake a full review of the policyarrangements in the coming year. While the primary driver for ourremuneration policy will continue to be the Group’s purpose andstrategy, the review will incorporate consideration of changes incorporategovernance and regulation, widerworkforcedevelopments and the latest investor guidance. We look forward toengaging with our shareholders and plan tohold meetings with ourlargest investors on matters relating to the proposed policy in2024.

Juniorcolleagues’ remuneration is principally fixed pay, reflecting ourprinciple of helping to support a decent standard of living, whereregular pay levels help with personal budgeting and planning. Formore senior colleagues, remuneration is weighted more towardsvariable pay,which can increase or decrease based on theperformance they achieve against our goals. This approach topay design also reflects each individual’s ability toinfluenceTesco’sperformance.While thebalance of theelements of remuneration maydiffer, ourconsistent overall principle is that all colleagues should be paidcompetitively against the relevant pay benchmark.We regularly ask colleagues across the Group how they feel aboutpay and benefits at Tesco. In our 2024 Every Voice Matterscolleague survey, 65% of colleagues agreed that the total rewardpackage at Tesco is competitive, which is well ahead of relevantexternal benchmarks. In addition, 83% of colleagues said they areable to work flexibly and 86% feel they can be themselves at Tesco,without fear of judgement. 73% of colleaguesfeel Tesco supportsthem with their wellbeing. Our colleagues are the heart of ourbusiness and Tesco remains committed to building an inclusiveworkplace where everyone can get on.Our ongoing initiatives include:—championing health and wellbeing to support our colleagues inand out of work through a defined offer of mental, physical andfinancial wellbeing;—ensuring inclusivity in everything we do by embedding inclusivebehaviours to build an inclusive workplace with a sense ofbelonging, led by inclusive leaders;—equipping our colleagues with the skills they need to succeednow and in the future through various skills and careerprogrammes; and—developing the next generationof talent through programmesfor interns, apprentices and graduates.Cascade of remunerationConsistent with best practice, the Committee spends considerabletime on matters relating toremuneration arrangements acrosstheGroup.

Given its success, we have introduced asimilar scheme for One Stop and Tesco Business Services in India,and will be looking to extend it further in 2024.Physical and emotional wellbeingWe have enhanced our health offer through the introduction of avirtual GP service. Since its launch in June 2023, colleagues havebenefited from more than 5,000 appointments from a qualifiedGP without placing an added burden on the NHS. We have alsoimproved our Employee Assistance Programme, giving colleaguesaccess to an expanded range of wellbeing services, including sleeptherapists, nutritionists, counsellors,exercisecoaches andphysiotherapists.Flexible workingWe continue to build our offer to support a flexible workingpattern. This includes part-time working, job shares, phasedretirement, lifestyle breaks and shift patterns to suit colleagueneeds. From July 2023, we introduced the right to request flexibleworking from day one of employment in all markets across ourGroup, waiving the 26 weeks qualifying criteria under UK law. Wehave also introduced Holiday Buy, enabling colleagues to increasetheir annual holiday.Supporting familiesWe continue to improve our offer across all markets andgeographies. Initiatives include enhanced guidance on coping withmenopause, pregnancy loss, IVF and fertility treatment anddomestic violence.We also enhanced our family policies to support colleagues withtime away from work when they need it most. These included anincrease to 26 weeks paid maternity and adoption leave in the UK,where we also became the first major employer to offer 26 weekspaid kinship leave for those given permanent custody of a child.In addition, we introduced one week of paid fertility leave for eachtreatment cycle, two weeks paid leave for women who lose theirbaby during pregnancy and 12 weeks paid neonatal care formothers whose babies are born prematurely.Thank you paymentIt is important to us that colleagues feel recognised for theircontribution to Tesco’s success. As a result of the strong Tescoperformance in 2023/24, the Company will be making Thank Youpayments to hourly-paid colleagues. For example, our CustomerAssistants in the UK will receive 1.5% of salary which means aone-off payment of more than £300 for a full-time colleague.Spotlight on:Rewarding our wider workforce.Tesco is a people business and our people will always be whatmakes us different. We aim to be a place where colleaguescan get on, as they wish, irrespective of their background.As part of this, we are committed to providing a rewardpackage that is competitive, simple, fair and sustainable, whileensuring we are responsible with our reward spend. We wantto make sure our colleagues feel secure, are rewardedcompetitively, and treated fairly and inclusively.The cost-of-living crisis has had a significant impact on peopleacross the world and we have spent considerable timethinking about how we can support our multiple stakeholders.For colleagues, this has resulted in a number of improvementsto the reward package and initiatives to support colleaguewellbeing.Investing in colleague payIn April 2023, we made our biggest ever investment in the payof hourly-paid UK Customer Assistants to £11.02. At the sametime, our Customer Assistants in ROI received a 4% increase,which was phase three of a three-year pay awardcommunicated to colleagues in 2022. We supported our ROIcolleagues further by bringing forward the pay award for 2024from April to January. In Booker, we increased our BranchAssistants’ hourly rate by more than 10%.Living wageWith the UK Government increasing the National Living Wageto £11.42, we have responded by raising the hourly rate for UKCustomer Assistants to £12.02 from 28 April 2024. This isahead of the voluntary Real Living Wage. The rate for Londonhas also been increased to £13.15 to match the Real LivingWage for London.PaytransparencyWe are now into our third year of providing a free online totalreward statement for all colleagues. This allows them to seetheir pay, bonus, retirement savings, details of shares they holdand share saving schemes they are part of. For salariedcolleagues, we also provide an annual pay and bonus statementwhich shows where they are positioned in their pay range.Colleague mealsAs a result of the cost-of-living challenges, a colleague roombudget was assigned so kitchens in all our stores could bestocked with free food for colleagues. Having receivedpositive feedback from colleagues, a colleague room budgetis now part of our ongoing reward offer. At Booker, weintroduced free food in all our branches.Financial resilienceWe continue to support through our Learn Borrow Saveinitiative, including Pay Advance for UK colleagues whichprovides a sustainable alternative to high interest lenders.To improve financial literacy, we have launched financialcoaching by qualified professionals.For colleagues in the UK, ROI and Central Europe, thecolleague discount has been increased from 10% to 15% onthe four days after each pay day and 20% at Christmas. We’vealso made it easier for colleagues to share their discount withfamily members, including those living at a different address.Our UK SAYE scheme continues to be popular, with more than50,000 colleagues participating. This allows colleagues to buyshares at a 20% discount and enjoy a tax-free bonus at the103.GovernanceFinancial statementsAdditional informationGovernanceStrategic report\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf6a ---\n","Relationship between the pay of the Group Chief Executiveand UKcolleaguesTesco is a retail business with one of the UK’s largest workforces.We employ around 260,000 UK-based colleagues in our majorsubsidiary, Tesco Stores Limited. These are mostly in customer-facing roles in-store or in our distribution network. Given theworkforce profile, all three of the Group Chief Executive pay ratioreference points compare our Group Chief Executive’sremuneration with that of colleagues in mainly customer-facingroles. There is relatively little difference in the outcomes, as weshow below. Whatever the Group Chief Executive pay ratio may be,Tesco will continue to invest in competitive pay for all colleagues.The following table shows the ratio between the consolidated singletotal figure of remuneration (STFR) of the Group Chief Executive for2023/24 and the lower, median and upper quartile pay of our UKcolleagues. We also show for comparison the pay ratios for the fiveprecedingyears.Total pay ratio2018/19 2019/20 2020/21 2021/222022/232023/24Ratio of CEO’s STFR25thpercentile247:1355:1136:1251:1231:1447:150thpercentile226:1305:1118:1224:1197:1431:175th percentile209:1279:1116:1216:1182:1388:1The table below sets out the base salary, total pay and benefitdetails of the Group Chief Executive and UK colleagues who are atthe 25th,50th and 75th percentile.2023/24Group Chief Executive’s base salary£1,411,433Group Chief Executive’s total pay and benefits£9,925,331UK colleagues’ salaryColleague at 25th percentile£20,916Colleague at 50th percentile£21,326Colleague at 75th percentile£24,171UK colleagues’ total pay and benefitsColleague at 25th percentile£22,180Colleague at 50th percentile£23,010Colleague at 75th percentile£25,583The total full-time equivalent (FTE) pay and benefits for the relevantcolleagues are based on the period from Sunday, 5 February 2023to Saturday, 3 February 2024. The reporting regulations offer threecalculation approaches for determining the pay ratio – Options A, Band C. We have chosen Option C for all years, which we deem themost appropriate methodology for Tesco.As more than half of Tesco’s colleagues work part-time, theexercise required to determine FTE is extensive and complex. Tescodecided to use Option C as we had completed comprehensive datacollation and analysis of all relevant colleagues for the purpose ofgender pay gap (GPG) reporting. This enabled us to use additionalpay data (including overtime, salary sacrifice values and employerpension contributions) to ensure the STFR reflects total pay madethroughout the financial year. This approach minimised thediffering definitions of pay for STFR and GPG to enable us to selectthe ‘best equivalents’ of P25, P50 and P75. The only adjustmentsmade to determine the pay and benefits of the colleaguesidentified as P25, P50 and P75 related to working hours, basingamounts on a 36.5-hour working week. We believe the ‘bestequivalent’colleagues identified are reasonably representativeof the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles as Tesco has compiled payon an FTE basis. We reviewed pay across a sample of colleaguesat each percentile before selecting the colleague who wasmost representative.In the case of the Group Chief Executive, his total remunerationincludes asignificant proportion of variablepay. The STFRtherefore varies considerably depending on the level ofperformance against the measures driving the annual bonus andPSP. The Group Chief Executive’s first PSP award will vest at 85.0%of maximum in 2024 and the annual bonus paid out at 95.0% ofmaximum compared with 79.1% in 2022/23, which have resulted ina rise in the Group Chief Executive’s pay ratio numbers this year.Since 2014, the median pay ratio has varied, increasing anddecreasing in alternate years in line with variable pay outcomes.As we set out onpage 94, we base our reward framework acrossthe Group on a consistent set of principles for all: that overallremuneration should be competitive when compared to similarroles in other organisations with which we compete for talent. Wetherefore determine colleague pay using the same principles as thepay for our Executive Directors. On this basis, we believe themedian ratio is consistent with the Company’s wider policies onemployee reward, pay and progression.Gender and ethnicity payOur business model is underpinned by understanding customersand creating a great place to work for our colleagues. It thereforefollows that we need a diverse and inclusive workplace thatrepresents the communities we serve.Our 2023 Gender Pay report suggests progress, with the mediangender pay gap for UK Retail reducing from 6.9% to 5.0%,significantly below the UK national average of 14.3%. The key factorbehind the gap is that a greater proportion of male colleagueswork in roles which carry a premium and increase pay. If we removepremium payments from our calculation, our median pay gapis2.9% and the mean pay gap reduces to 7.8%. Adjusting for thesefactors would reduce the pay gap to nil.The mean gender bonus gap for Tesco Stores Limited has alsoreduced, from 30.5% to 30.2%. The main factor behind the gap is agreater proportion of male colleagues in senior roles which attracthigher bonus levels.We have introduced a number of initiatives to improve theproportion of women at leadershiplevels. Theseinclude supportfor flexible working, making it easier for women to work at Tesco.We are also making progress in ethnic representation. Although nota requirement, we have chosen to publish our ethnicity pay gapwhich shows that the median gap for UK Retail is (4.6)% (i.e. themedian pay for ethnically diverse colleagues is higher than for whitecolleagues). The primary factor is a greater tendency for ethnicallydiverse colleagues to work unsociable hours which carry apremium, plus a lower likelihood of selecting salary sacrificebenefits. The ethnicity bonus gap mean is 31.8%, reflecting a lowerproportion of ethnically diverse colleagues in senior roles. As withgender, we have introduced initiatives to improve representation atsenior levels, including the inclusion of diversity measures in ourPerformance Share Plan.See our Everyone’s Welcome Report for more information at:www.tescoplc.com/media/btxmk3vi/tesco-everyones-welcome-report-2023Change in remuneration of colleagues and DirectorsThe table opposite shows the percentage change in the annualremuneration of Directors and the average UK colleague overthe past five years.The reporting regulations require disclosure of the change inremuneration of employees of the parent company. As the onlyemployees of this company are the Executive Directors, theCommittee decided to use the average UK colleague as theappropriate comparator group. This is because they representthe majority of Tesco colleagues and the Executive Directorsare predominantly based in the UK.Corporate governance report continuedDirectors’ remuneration report continuedTesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024104.Governance\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf6b ---\n","Salary/fees (% change)Benefits(e)(% change)Bonus (% change)(e)2023/242022/23 2021/222020/21 2019/202023/242022/23 2021/22 2020/21 2019/202023/242022/23 2021/22 2020/21 2019/20ExecutiveDirectorsKenMurphy2.8%1.7% 0%––(50.0)%170.5% 18.9%––23.7%(14.8)% 100%––ImranNawaz4.0%3.7% – – –(24.8)%162.2% – – –25.1%(8.3)% –––Non-executiveDirectorsMelissaBethell3.1%3.2%2.2% 2.2%172.7%––––––– – – –BertrandBodson3.1%2.5% – – –––––––– – – –CarolynFairbairn(a)–––––––––––––––ThierryGarnier3.1%2.3% – – –––––––– – – –StewartGilliland(b)25.0%2.8%2.8%5.0%42.3%––––––– – – –ByronGrote5.2%12.3% 12.3%3.0%3.9%––––––– – – –GerryMurphy(a)–––––––––––––––AlisonPlatt8.1%13.8% 2.8%5.0%17.4%––––––– – – –CarolineSilver4.2%–––––––KarenWhitworth3.6%3.0%–––––––––––––FormerDirectorsJohnAllan(c)1.3%1.3%0%1.5%3.4%(47.1)%112.5%14.3%(46.2)%62.5%–– – – –LindseyPownall(c)0.8%9.2% 9.2%1.9%2.9%––––––––––ColleaguesAverage UKcolleague(d)9.1%8.6%3.3% 6.8% 3.0%0%0%0% 0%0%N/AN/A N/A N/A(100)%(a)Carolyn Fairbairn and Gerry Murphy both joined the Board on 1 September 2023, so no year-on-year comparison is possible.(b) The fee increase for Stewart Gilliland reflects his appointments as Chair of the Sustainability Committee and a member of the Nominations and GovernanceCommittee and Remuneration Committee on 16 June 2023.(c)John Allan and Lindsey Pownall both stepped down from the Board on 16 June 2023.

Whensetting and operating the policy, the Committee aligns reward toperformance to promote the long-term success of the Group andhas regard to policies and practices relating to workforceremuneration, the experiences of other stakeholders andalignment with purpose, strategy and culture. This means we canrecruit, retain and motivate our executives as part of an integratedoverall approach to remuneration.Committee’s priorities in 2024/25As well as considering its standard business, the Committee willalso focus during 2024/25 on areas including:—commencing work on the remuneration policy review. We willmaintainan ongoing dialoguewith our major shareholders andother stakeholders and engagewith them individually andcollectively on proposed changes. The remuneration policy willbe put to shareholders at the 2025 AGM;—monitoring developments on our purpose and strategy toensure remuneration practices and policies continue to beconsistent with the Group’s long-term goals and aligned to theinterests of all our stakeholders;—ensuring all aspects of remuneration are viewed through asustainability lens. This will include monitoring our currentsustainability measures and considering whether new measuresshould be used for future PSP awards to reflect our evolvingsustainability strategy;—ensuring colleagues’ views on pay, policies and practices areattained through the Colleague Contribution Panels, Every VoiceMatters surveys and meetings and that these are reflected inthe decisions the Committee takes; and—continuing to monitor and oversee wider workforceremuneration, policies and practices. This aims to ensure payfairness and transparency across the workforce, that there is aconsistent cascade throughout the Group and that the rewards,incentives and conditions available to colleagues are taken intoaccount when considering the remuneration of ExecutiveDirectors and senior executives.Colleague engagement andunderstandingcolleague payEngaging with colleagues and understanding their views is vital tothe Committee and its decision making. During the year, sixColleague Contribution Panels (CCPs) were held. They provide anopportunity to seek the views of colleagues from across the Groupon executive pay and other areas of specific interestto the Board,its Committees and our colleagues. They also allow colleagues togain an understanding of the role and responsibilities of the Boardand its Committees and provide colleagues with the opportunity toask any questions. We set out further details of this year’s CCPs onpage 69.In addition, Directors regularly visit stores, distribution centres,customer engagement centres and offices to meet with colleaguesto gauge their overall opinions and assess our culture. We use theinformation provided by colleagues to guide our approach toExecutive Director and senior executive remuneration.The Committee believes it is important to understand howcolleague pay and other key colleague metrics operate throughoutthe Group. The Committee therefore reviews the findings from theEvery Voice Matters colleague survey and receives regular updatesthroughout the year on colleague metrics and outcomes via thewider workforce dashboard, which sets out a broad range ofinformation, including:—a summary of colleague demographics;—colleague pay positioning split by location;—a summary of colleague pay versus comparators;—salary budgets by business;—incentive outcomes by business;—CEO pay ratio; and—gender and ethnicity pay gaps.The Committee is therefore well positioned to take into accountcolleagues views and pay when setting the pay of ExecutiveDirectors and senior executives.Committeegovernance.We strive to ensure incentives encourage theachievement of our purpose and strategic priorities,and management is rewarded in line with overallbusiness performance and the wider experienceof our key stakeholders.Corporate governance report continuedDirectors’ remuneration report continuedTesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024112.Governance\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf73 ---\n","Discretion in relation to incentive plansThe Committee operates the annual bonus and PSP in accordancewith their respective scheme rules and the relevant Listing Rulesconsistent with market practice. The Committee retains discretion,within the confines and opportunity detailed above, regarding theoperation and administration of these plans. The discretion covers:—the timing, size and type of awards, holding periods and theannual setting oftargets;—when performance against our qualitative performancemeasures is not in line with the Group’s overall financial orstrategic performance over the performance period;—ensuring compliance with the rules, including in relation towhether or not malus or clawback provisions should apply, inconnection with recruitment, or terminations of employment,or corporate events affecting the Company;—adjustments required in certain circumstances, including rightsissues, corporate-restructuring events, special dividends andother corporate actions; and—adjustments to targets and/or measures if events occur thatcause the Committee to determine it is appropriate to do so.The Committee also retains the right to change performancemeasures and the weighting of measures in certaincircumstances including:—following feedback from regulators, shareholders and/or otherstakeholders; and—amendingthe scheme rules in accordance withtheir termsand/or amending the basis of operation (including but notlimited to the approach in respect of dividend equivalents).The Committee will disclose any exercise of discretion inaccordance with regulatory requirements.Malus and clawback provisionsThe Committee has the discretion to scale back deferred shareawards and PSP awards prior to the satisfaction of such awards if:—results are materially misstated;—the participanthas contributedto serious reputational damageto the Company or one of its business units;—the participant’s conduct has amounted to serious misconduct,fraud, dishonesty, a breach of the Code of Business Conduct ormaterial wrongdoing;—the determination of the vesting or value of an award has beenaffected by an underlying incorrect figure in the accounts; or—an error or miscalculation in determining the vesting or value ofan award is identified.Under malus, deferred share awards and unvested PSP awards canbe reduced (including down to zero) or be made subject toadditional conditions. Clawback allows for the repayment ofpreviously paid-up cash bonuses for a period of three years andPSP awards for a period of two years after the vesting date. Theclawback periods align with the bonus deferral period and PSPholding period. No such provisions were used during 2023/24.Approach totarget settingIn determining the range of targets for each measure for the annualbonus and 2024 PSP grant, the Committee considered theBoard-approved budget and LTP, external consensus where itexists, prior-yearachievementand the wider economicenvironment. As part of itswork to ensure targets areappropriately stretching, the Committee also considered theBoard’s assessment of how achievable the budget is. Theperformance target range is set on a realistic basis but requirestrue outperformance to achieve the maximum. The Committee hasa history of setting stretching targets as evidenced by an averagePSP payout of 64.8% over the past five years.The annual bonus measures are selected to provide directalignment with the Group’s short-term operational targets. TheCommittee takes care to ensure that the short-term performancemeasures are supportive of the strategic priorities and long-termobjectives. The PSP performance measures are selected to ensurethat executives are encouraged in, and appropriately rewarded for,delivering against the Group’s purpose and strategic priorities.This ensures a clear line of sight and alignment of interests betweenexecutives and stakeholdersand the generation of long-termsustainable returns.Annual bonus and PSP performance is monitored every six monthsby the Committee. At the end of the performance period, one yearfor the annual bonus and three years for the PSP, we assess theformulaic outcome of each performance measure on a standalonebasis. The Committee considers whether the formulaic outcomesare fair in the context of the Group’s performance and the widerstakeholder experience. The Committee may seek independentadvice to assess the outcomes of specific measures as well as theoverall outcome. Where appropriate, the Committee also has theability to use its discretion to adjust the formulaic outcomes.2023/24Early Feb2023The Committee considered the wider contextand how the annual bonus and PSP targetswere tracking against forecast performance.Late Feb2023The Committee considered the proposedstructures of the annualbonus and PSPawards and the possible targets and ranges.In doing so, it had regard to:—wider workforce remuneration;—the budget and LTP;—the strategicplan;—analysts’ consensusforecasts; and—the wider economicenvironment.April2023The Board approved the budget for the year.The Committee determined the measures,weightings and targets for the annual bonusand PSP for the forthcoming year and theoutcomes of the prior year’s annualbonusand2020 PSP.October2023The Committee considered how the annualbonus and PSP targets were tracking againstforecast performance.113.Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024GovernanceFinancial statementsAdditional informationGovernanceStrategic report\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf74 ---\n","Committee advisorTo ensure that the Committee continues to operate in line withbest practice, it has appointed PwC as an independent externaladvisor.

Under that law, the Directorsare required toprepare the Group financial statements inaccordance with UK-adopted international accounting standardsand applicable UK law. The Directors have also chosen to preparethe Parent Company financial statements in accordance withUnited Kingdom Generally Accepted AccountingPractice (UnitedKingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law), includingFinancial Reporting Standard (FRS) 101 Reduced DisclosureFramework. Under company law, the Directors must not approvethe financial statements unlessthey are satisfied that they givea true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and ofthe profit or loss of the Company for that period.In preparing the ParentCompanyfinancial statements, theDirectors are required to:—select suitable accounting policies and then apply themconsistently;—make judgements and accounting estimates that arereasonableand prudent;—state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have beenfollowed, subject to any material departures disclosed andexplained in the financial statements; and—prepare the financial statements on the going concern basisunless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company willcontinue in business.In preparing the Group financial statements, InternationalAccounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:—properly selectand apply accountingpolicies;—present information, including accounting policies, in a mannerthat provides relevant, reliable, comparable andunderstandable information;—provideadditional disclosures when compliance with thespecific requirements inIFRSs are insufficient to enable users tounderstand the impact of particular transactions, other eventsand conditions on the entity’s financial position and financialperformance; and—make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as agoing concern.The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accountingrecords that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’stransactionsand disclose withreasonable accuracy at any timethefinancial position of the Company, and enable them to ensure thatthe financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of theCompany and hence for taking reasonable steps for the preventionand detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors areresponsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate andfinancial information included on the Company’s website.Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation anddissemination offinancialstatements may differ from legislation inother jurisdictions. Each of the serving Directors, whose names andfunctions are set out onpages 52 to 54, confirms that, to the bestof their knowledge:—the financial statements,prepared in accordance with therelevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair viewof the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss ofthe Company and the undertakings included in theconsolidation taken as a whole;—the Strategic report includes a fair review of the developmentand performance of the business and the position of theCompany and the undertakings included in the consolidationtaken as a whole, together with a description of the principalrisks and uncertainties that they face; and—the Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024, taken as awhole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide theinformation necessary for shareholders to assess theCompany’s positionand performance, business model andstrategy.By order of the BoardRobert WelchGroup Company Secretary9 April 2024Information required to be disclosed under the Listing Rules can be found on the following pages.Listing Rule 9.8.4RPagesStatement ofcapitalised interest147 to 149Allotment for cash of equity securities145 to 147Waiver of dividends116 and 154Listing Rule 9.8.6(8)PagesClimate-related financial disclosures consistent with TCFD39 to 45Listing Rule 9.8.6(9) and (10)PagesDiversity disclosures76 to77Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024116.Governance\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf77 ---\n","Report on the audit ofthe financial statements.Financial statementsIndependent auditor’s report to the members of Tesco PLC1.

Ourresponsibilities under thosestandards arefurther described in theauditor’s responsibilities forthe audit ofthe financial statementssection of our report.We are independent of the Group and the Parent Company inaccordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to ouraudit of the financial statements in the UK,including theFinancialReporting Council’s (the ‘FRC’s’) Ethical Standard as applied tolisted public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethicalresponsibilities in accordance with these requirements.Thenon-audit services provided to the Group and Parent Company forthe year are disclosed inNote3(Operating expenses) to thefinancial statements. We confirm that we have not provided anynon-audit services prohibited by the FRC’s Ethical Standard to theGroup or the Parent Company.We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficientand appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.3. Summary of our audit approachKey audit mattersThe key audit matters that we identified in the current year were:—store impairmentreview;—recognition of commercial income;—Tesco Bank loan impairment;—disposal of Banking operations;—pension valuation;and—retail technology environment, includingIT security.Within this report, key audit matters are identified as follows:NewlyidentifiedIncreased level of riskSimilar level of riskDecreased level of riskMaterialityThe materiality that we used for theGroup financial statementswas £115m (2022/23: £100m) which was determined on the basis of4.92% (2022/23: 4.64%) of total adjusted profit before tax, fromboth continuing and discontinued operations, (including netpension finance income/(cost)) as described further onpage 123.ScopingOur audit scoping provides full scope and specified scope auditcoverage of 97% (2022/23: 97%) of revenue from continuingoperations, 92% (2022/23: 93%) of operating profit from continuingoperations and 92% (2022/23: 96%) of total assets.In relation to discontinued operations we performed full scopeaudit procedures covering 100% of revenue and operating profit aswell as 100% of total assets of the disposal group and non-currentassets heldfor sale.Significant changes in our approachOur 2023/24 report includes a new key audit matter relating to thedisposalof the Banking operations of Tesco Bank.We no longer report Tesco Bank goodwill impairment as a key auditmatter due to:—the reduction in the residual goodwill balance following theallocation of goodwill between Banking operations and theremaining insurance and money services businesses, and thesubsequent impairment of the Banking operations goodwill; and—the increased headroom and reduced sensitivity of theinsurance and money services businesses, arising fromincreases in the forecast future cash flows and the decreaseddiscount rate applied in 2023/24.There are no other significant changes in our approach incomparison to the prior year.4. Conclusions relating to going concernIn auditing the financial statements, wehave concluded that theDirectors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in thepreparation of the financial statementsis appropriate.Our evaluation of the Directors’ assessment of the Group’s andParent Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concernbasis of accounting included:—obtaining confirmation for the financing facilities includingTesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024117.GovernanceAdditional informationFinancial statementsStrategic report\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf78 ---\n","Financial statements continuedIndependent auditor’s report to the members of Tesco PLC continuednature of facilities, repayment terms and any covenants toassess that these facilities remain available at year end;—assessing the reasonableness of the assumptions used in theGroup’s funding plan approved by the Board;—testing the clerical accuracy used to prepare the forecastsincluding obtainingan understanding of relevant controls overmanagement’s model;—reviewing the liquidity forecast and undertaking sensitivities toassess whether there is sufficient headroom;—challenging the assumptions used within the Group’s goingconcern model by obtaining third-party and market data andevaluating any differences between this dataand the judgementand assumptions used;—evaluating the historical accuracy of forecasts prepared bymanagement;—considering the mitigating factorsidentified by managementinrelation to their going concern analysis;—assessing whether the remaining money services and insuranceservices business is self-funding and no further investment isrequired from the Group; and—assessing the appropriateness of the Group’s disclosureconcerning the going concern basis.Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified anymaterial uncertainties relating to events or conditions that,individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on theGroup’s and Parent Company’s ability to continue as a goingconcern for a period of at least 12 months from when the financialstatements are authorised for issue.In relation to the reporting on how the Group has applied the UKCorporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add ordraw attention to in relation to the Directors’ statement in thefinancial statements about whether the Directorsconsidered itappropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors withrespect to going concern are described in the relevant sections ofthis report.5. Key audit mattersKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professionaljudgement, were of most significance inour audit ofthe financialstatements of the current period and include the most significantassessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due tofraud) that we identified. These matters included those which hadthe greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocationof resources in the audit and directing the efforts of theengagement team.These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of thefinancial statements as awhole, and in formingour opinion thereon,and wedo not provide a separateopinion on thesematters.5.1. Store impairment reviewKey audit matter descriptionAs described inNote1(Accounting policies, judgements and estimates),Note11(Property, plant andequipment) andNote 12(Leases) of thefinancial statements, theGroupheld £17,221m (2022/23: £16,862m) of property, plantand equipment and£5,478m of right of useassets(2022/23: £5,500m) at 24 February 2024.Under IAS 36 ‘Impairment of Assets’, the Group is required to complete an impairment review of its store portfolio where thereare indicatorsof impairment or impairment reversal. Judgement is requiredin identifying indicators of impairment charges or reversals and estimation isrequired in determining the recoverable amount of the Group’s store portfolio.Where a review for impairment, or reversal of impairment, is conducted, the recoverable amount is determined based on the higher of ‘valueinuse’ or ‘fair value less costs of disposal’.Value in use has been calculated using probability-weighted cash flows reflectingmanagement’s best estimateof the impact of theeconomicenvironment and climate change onthe future trading performance of the Group. Further details of theprobability-weighted cashflows are setout inNote 14(Impairmentof non-current assets) ofthe financial statements.Management estimate the fair value less coststo dispose of the stores with theassistance of independent professional valuers.Externalvaluations are obtainedfor a sampleof stores, the results of which are then used bymanagement’s in-house experts to determine the fairvalue of the other properties. Further details of the basis for the valuation are set out inNote 14.The key audit matter relates specifically to the UK trading store portfolio which represents 79% of both the Group’s property,plant andequipmentand right of use assetbalances.In makingtheir assessmentof value inuse and fair value less coststo dispose,management has considered the impactof the macroeconomictrading environment (including the continued impact of cost of living increases and ongoing fluctuations in energy costs and inflation) onforecast cash flows and property fair values where conditions existed at the balance sheet date.Management’s impairment reviewis sensitive to changes in the key assumptions as setout inNote 14. Significant judgement is required toforecast store cash flows which are derived from the Board-approved Long Term Plan (LTP) and also in relation to capital and restructuringadjustments made to the LTP cash flows so that the impairment model cash flows comply with IAS 36.  In particular, the impairment model issensitive to changes to the Year 3 cash flow as this cash flow is discounted into the long term in the value in use calculation.Key areas of judgement inthe cash flow forecastsinclude the ability of management toachieve their forecastsin lightof changing consumerbehaviour, the ongoing volatile retail environment and the Group’s ability to realise forecast cost savings.Other areas of key estimation in the store impairment review are as follows:—the probability applied toeach cash flowscenario in calculating the probability-weighted cashflows;—the discount rateand long-term growth rateused to determine value in use from the probability-weighted cash flows; and—the fair value of properties supporting the carrying value of store assets, in particular in response to the changing retail and broaderproperty landscape.The LTP is prepared on a top-down basis and not at an individual store level. Managementperform anexercise to allocate forecastperformance across individual stores within the portfolio ensuring cash flows derived from the LTP are in accordance with IAS 36. Thisincreasesthe complexity and levelof judgementwithin the impairment model.Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024118.Financial statements\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf79 ---\n","5.1. Store impairment reviewcontinuedAs a result of the Group’s store impairment review completed during the year, a net impairment reversal of £28m (2022/23: impairment loss£982m) was recognised. This includes an impairment charge of £572m (2022/23: £1,250m) and an impairment reversal of £600m (2022/23:£268m). The sensitivities associated withmanagement’s impairmentreview are presented withinNote 14to the financialstatements.The Audit Committee’s discussion of this key audit matter is set out onpage 86.How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matterOur audit procedures included obtaining an understanding of the relevant controls around the impairment review process, including the budgetand forecast setting processes which support the cash flows used in the impairment model.Our procedures in relation to the Group’s value in use assessment included:—challenging the key assumptions utilised in the cash flow forecasts with reference to historical trading performance, the wider economicenvironment (including possible macroeconomic impacts of the continued cost-of-living crisis and ongoing fluctuationsin energycosts andinflation), anticipatedchanges in consumer behaviour, competitoractions, our understanding ofthe Group’s strategic initiatives, climatechange considerations and ourwider industry knowledge;—reviewing the accuracy of past forecasts of growth rates and future cash flows to assess the level of accuracy of the forecasting process;—performing sensitivity analyses to assess the impacton impairmentof a change in the probability percentages applied to the cashflowscenarios;—involving valuation specialiststo evaluate management’s inputsto, andthe appropriateness of, their discount rate and the validity oftheirlong-term growth rate;—assessingand challenging theadequacy ofmanagement’s sensitivity analysis in relation to key assumptions to considerthe extent of changein those assumptions that, either individually or collectively, would be required to lead to a significant further impairment charge or reversal,in particular forecast cash flows, discount rates and property fair values, in light of increased market volatility due to thecontinuedcost-of-living crisis and ongoing fluctuations in energy prices and inflation;—performed testingon all the datainputs and model outputs, along with stand-back assessments to identify unusual trends and understandthe factors driving themovement orany indicators ofmanagement bias;—assessing the methodology applied in determining the value in use compared with the requirements of IAS 36, including challenging theappropriateness of excluding certain cash flows contained within the LTP which were determined as not permissible under IAS 36;and—assessing the mechanical accuracy and integrity of the value in use model prepared by the Group, with the assistance of our specialistmodellingteam.In relation to the Group’s stores where their value is supported by fair value less costs to dispose (rather than value in use), our proceduresincluded challenging the assumptions used by the Group in determining the fair market value, including those completed by external valuersandassessing whether appropriate valuation methodologies have been applied. Where stores are supported by their fair values less costs todisposebut management plan to continueto trade inthe store, we have challenged managementas to why the fair value isappropriate in thesecircumstances. We have involved property valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the fair value less cost to sell and, aspart of our workperformed, wehave evaluated the competence, capability and objectivity ofmanagement’s valuers.Wealso evaluated whetherthere was appropriate disclosure regarding sensitivities associated withmanagement’s impairmentreview.Key observationsBased on our audit procedures we are satisfied that the assumptions in the impairment models are within an acceptable range, and that theestimate of the Group’s net impairment reversal is reasonable.We also consider the disclosures, including the sensitivity disclosure, inNote 14to be appropriate.5.2. Recognition of commercial incomeKey audit matter descriptionAs described inNote1(Accounting policies, judgements and estimates) andNote 20(Commercialincome) ofthe financial statements, theGroup has agreements withsuppliers whereby volume-related allowances, promotional and marketing allowances and variousother fees anddiscounts are received in connection with the purchase of goods for resale from those suppliers.As such, the Group recognises a reduction in cost of sales as a result of amounts received from those suppliers. Commercial income shouldonly be recognised asincome within theincome statementwhen the performance conditions associatedwith it havebeen met, forexamplewhere the underlying product promotions have gone live in stores.The variety andnumber of thebuying arrangementswith suppliersmeans there is complexity in determiningif the performance conditionsassociatedwith the income have been satisfied, giving riseto a requirement for management judgement.As such wehave identified this as akey audit matter and considered that there was a potential for fraud pinpointed to the possible manipulation of the income forpromotionalspace deal types within the UK retail business. In comparison to prior years, we consider the risks related to commercial income from costprice reconciliation deal types in the UK retail business to have reduced as the quantum of the commercial income from these arrangementshas reduced.The Audit Committee’s discussion of this key audit matter is set out onpage 86.Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024119.GovernanceAdditional informationFinancial statementsStrategic report\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf7a ---\n","Financial statements continuedIndependent auditor’s report to the members of Tesco PLC continued5.2. Recognition of commercial incomecontinuedHow the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matterOur audit procedures included obtaining an understanding of relevant controls that the Group has established in relation to commercialincome recognition.In addition, we performed the following:—used data analytics toidentify commercial incomedeals with particular characteristics, such asthose relatedto promotionalspace, andcarried out further procedures on these, including arranging one on one meetings with individual Tesco buyers and third party supplierrepresentatives;—considered whether amounts recognised were accurate and recorded in the correct period by circularising a sample of supplierstodetermine whether the arrangements recorded were in accordancewith the termsagreed in advance withthe suppliers with regardto thenature, timing and amount of the promotions and deals. We evaluated all supplier confirmation responses and investigated all exceptionsreported to us, if any, to determine the effect on reported commercial income or on our confirmation sampling plan. We obtaineda 100%response rate from the suppliers in our sample, and therefore we did not need to consider alternative procedures;—evaluated the year-end accrual for promotional deals to assess whether performance obligations have been fulfilled where theyhave beeninvoicedsubsequentto year end;—held discussions withcertain suppliers and members of the Group’s buying personnelin order to: further understand relevantarrangements; gain further insights on theimpact ofeconomic trends on specifics andassociated costprices; discuss the IT applicationsused to administer and process commercial income deals; and identify if there are any disputes or other issues that we should be aware offor further investigation;—testedthe completeness of commercialincome by evaluating management’s review and conclusions relatedto any commercial incomedealsthat were unrecorded and performing analytical procedures to identify deals where performance obligations have been fulfilled but invoicingcould not occur due to pending final administrative procedures;—testedcommercial incomebalances included withininventories and trade and other receivables, ornetted against trade and other payables(as set out inNote20) via balance sheet reconciliation procedures; and—assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures made in relation tocommercial incomein the Group’s financial statements.Key observationsBased on our audit procedures we are satisfied that the recognition of commercial income is satisfactory. We consider the disclosure given inthe financialstatements around commercialincome providesan appropriateunderstanding of the types of rebate incomereceivedand theimpact on the Group’s balance sheet.5.3. Tesco Bank loan impairmentKey audit matter descriptionAs disclosedinNote7(Discontinued operations), the Group held an expected credit loss (ECL) provision in respect of loans and advances tocustomers of £433m at 24 February 2024 (2022/23: £460m) classified under assets of the disposal group held for sale in the Group balancesheet. TheECL on loans and advances to customers charged tothe income statement and classified under discontinued operationswas £65min the year to 24 February 2024 (2022/23: £60m). The decrease in the ECL provision during the year is primarily due to an improvedmacroeconomic economic outlook and reduction in post-model adjustments (PMAs), partially offset by the growth in the lending portfoliointhe current year.Loan impairment remainsone of the most significantjudgements made by management. We consider the most significant areaof judgementtobe within the Group’s collective provisioning methodologies; we therefore identified the key audit matter within loan impairment as relating tothe macroeconomic scenarios applied in the calculation of the provision.ECLprovisionsare calculated on a forward-looking basisunder IFRS9 ‘FinancialInstruments’. Management, with the assistanceof externaleconomic specialists, apply significant judgement indetermining the forecast macroeconomic scenariosand the probabilityweighting ofeachof the scenarios that are incorporated into the ECL model.Other judgementsinclude the determination of the expected lifetime,the definitionof a significant increasein credit risk, the determination ofprobabilityof default, the assessmentof the effect ofcost of living and cost of borrowingon the borrower’saffordability,the identificationofloss events and the determination of loss given default.Given the impact of thesignificant judgements taken by management in themeasurementof the ECL provision, we also consider there is aninherent risk of fraud asthese judgements are subject tothe risk ofmanagement bias.Management’s associated accountingpolicies are detailed inNote 1, including detail aboutthe judgements made in applying accounting policiesand key accounting estimates.The Audit Committee’s discussion of this key audit matter is set out onpage 86.How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matterWehave obtainedan understanding of relevant controls, including those linked tothe review andapproval of macroeconomic scenarios,modelgovernance forums, model monitoring, validation and calibration (including the determination of PMAs), the flow of data from the Group’sinformation systems into the ECL model and the flow of the output of the ECL model to the general ledger. Our audit work to address the keyaudit matter included the procedures noted below.—With support from internal economic modelling specialists, we challenged the macroeconomic scenario forecasts thatwere incorporatedinto the ECLmodel, includingmanagement’s selection ofthe relevant macroeconomic variables. We assessed management’s forecasts andtheir probability against independenteconomic outlooks, external analystsand marketdata, toassess their reasonableness, consideringtheforecasts in light of any contradictory information.—We also assessed the competence, capability, and objectivity of management’sexternal economic specialist,who supplies themacroeconomic forecasts to management, and considered whetherthe methodology adopted by the expert was reasonable.Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024120.Financial statements\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf7b ---\n","5.3. Tesco Bank loan impairmentcontinued—We evaluated whether there was appropriate disclosure on loan impairment, including the macroeconomic scenarios selected bymanagement, theirprobability weighting, and therelated sensitivities.Key observationsBased on ouraudit procedures we aresatisfied thatmanagement’s provision is reasonablystated and is supported by a methodologythatiscompliant with IFRS 9. We consider the sensitivity disclosures provided inNote7(Discontinuedoperations) to thefinancial statements to beappropriate.5.4. Disposal of Banking operationsKey audit matter descriptionAs set out inNote 7(Discontinued operations), in February 2024 the Groupreached agreementon the termsof a proposed sale of its bankingoperations,comprising personalloans, credit cards, customer deposits, andassociated operational capabilities (‘Banking operations’) forconsiderationof £600m. The sale is conditional on court sanction and regulatory approval or non-objection,as is typical of the transfer ofbanking operations, and is expected to complete in the second half of 2024/25. Subsequent to the completion of the sale, the Group will enterinto a new partnershipagreement with theacquirer to continue to offer a broad rangeof bankingproducts tonew and existing customers.At the date Banking operations were re-classified as held for sale, the Group determined that the £500m goodwill previously allocated to TescoBank should be allocated between the Banking operations disposal group (£211m), with the remainder (£289m) relating to the continuinginsuranceand money services operations retained on the Group balance sheet.The Banking operations assets of £7,698m and liabilities of £7,122m have been classified as held for sale in the Group balancesheet with theGroup incomestatement presented toshow the results as adiscontinued operation, forwhich the comparatives havebeen restatedon aconsistent basis.Upon classification as held for sale the Group recognised a £732m loss on remeasuring the disposal group to fair value less cost to sell. £211m ofthe losswas allocated to goodwill and£96m to other assets ofthe disposalgroup withinthe scope of themeasurementrequirements of IFRS 5‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations’ and which were therefore fully written off. The excess loss remaining was thenrecognised as a reduction in the total assets of the disposal group, whichprimarily comprise loans and advances to customers measured underIFRS 9.We have identified the disposal of the Banking operations business as a key audit matter because of the significant estimates and accountingconclusions related to:—the timing of the held for sale criteria being met;—the perimeter of the assets and liabilities included within discontinued operations;—the calculation of the loss on disposal, predominantly related to the allocation of goodwill;—the remeasurement of the Bankingoperations net assetsto the lower of carrying valueor fair value less costs to sell;—the allocation of the loss to assets within the disposal group and the treatment of the excess loss;—the split of indirect costs between the Banking operations and remaining insurance and money services business; and—whether any of thefuture income to be generated fromthe partnershipagreement is considered deferred consideration.The Audit Committee’s discussion of this key audit matter is set out onpage 86.How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matterOur audit procedures included obtaining an understanding of relevant controls that the Group has established in relation to thesale of theBankingoperationsbusiness.We have also performed specific audit procedures to address the key audit matter which included the following:—Evaluating the entity’s accounting conclusions in respect of the relevant accounting standards for the disposal including:—Timing of held for sale criteria being met;—The presentation of Banking operations aspart of discontinued operations;—Allocation of the loss to assets within the disposal group and the treatment of the excess loss; and—Treatmentof the future incometo be earned underthe partnershipagreement and the judgement that noelements ofthis shouldberecognised as deferred consideration.—Involving valuation specialists to assess the appropriateness of the relative fair values of the Banking operations and the remaining insuranceand ancillary money services businessused to determine the allocation of goodwill;—Challenging management’s forecasts used to calculate the relative fair values of the Banking business and the remaining insurance andmoney services businessused to determine the allocation of goodwillfrom a consistentmarket participant point of view;—Recalculating the loss on remeasuring the disposal group to fair value less cost to sell and the excess loss allocated to thedisposal group;—Testing the accuracy and completeness of the perimeter of the disposal of the Banking operations business and the split of indirect costsbetween the Banking operations andthe remaining insuranceand money services business;and—Evaluating the appropriateness of disclosures made in thefinancialstatements, including the current yearpresentation of theassets andliabilitiesof the Banking operations beingsold as held for sale and thepresentation asa discontinuedoperation within the incomestatement; and—Testing therelated restatement of theprior year income statement comparatives.Key observationsBased on our audit procedures we are satisfied that the Group’s accounting conclusions and the calculation and allocation of the loss onremeasuring the disposal group to fair value less cost to sell are appropriate.

The net retirementdeficit of£635m (2022/23: £394m) before deferred tax comprises schemesin surplusof £22m(2022/23: £6m) and schemes in deficit of £657m (2022/23: £400m).The valuation of the Group’s pension obligations is sensitive to changes in key assumptions and is dependent on market conditions. The keyaudit matter specifically relates to the key financial and demographic assumptions linked to the valuation of the UK retail pension planobligations: discount rate, inflation expectations, and mortality assumptions. The setting of these assumptions is complex andrequires theexercise ofsignificant management judgement withthe support of management’s actuaries.The Audit Committee’s discussion of this key audit matter is set out onpage 86.How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matterOur audit procedures included obtaining an understanding of relevant controls in relation to the pension obligation valuation process.In addition, we involved our actuarial specialists to assess the key actuarial assumptions used, both financial and demographic, and consideredthe methodology utilised to derive theseassumptions.In order toassess and challengethe reasonableness of management’s discount rate, weindependently calculated an appropriate rangefrom available marketdata and compared this to management’s rate.Working with our actuarial experts, we benchmarked and challenged assumptions used by management in determiningthe value ofpensionliabilities, particularly focusing onthe discountrate, inflation andmortality assumptions. This included comparingthe inputs andassumptionsused in determining the valuation of the UK retail pension plan to those used in comparable pension plans and our internal benchmarks. Inparticular, we considered the incorporation of, and weighting factors applied to, the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI)2022 mortalitytables which include the updated 2022 actual mortality experience, with reference to advice the Group has received from its actuaries.Additionally, we haveconsidered the competence, capabilityandobjectivity of the actuaries engaged by management to perform valuations ofthe relevant plans.Key observationsBased on our audit procedures we are satisfied that the overall methodology is appropriate, and the key assumptions applied inrelation todetermining the pension valuation are reasonable.5.6. Retail technology environmentKey audit matter descriptionThe Group’s retailtechnology environment iscomplex and asignificant element of itsfinancial processes and businessoperations aredependent on automated processesand controls.In the current and previous years, we have reported certain IT control deficiencies within the retail IT systems which could have an adverseimpact on the Group’s controls and financial reporting systems.Management has continued to implement itsmulti-year remediation planon controldeficiencies related to Application User AccessManagement andPrivileged Access Management. ITremediation isacomplex project which includes the remediation of IT deficiencies applyingmanagement judgement acrossa range of internallyand externally hosted systemsand processes which are at risk of being inappropriatelydesigned or executed.Areas of management’s remediation programme to which the key audit matter has been pinpointed include:—appropriateness of remediated access controls across in-scope applications and their supporting infrastructure; and—whether the remediated controls address previously identified deficiencies.The Audit Committee’s discussion of this key audit matter is set out onpage 85.How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matterConsistent with previous years, we did not plan to take a control-reliant audit approach in the retail business due to the deficiencies in the ITenvironment and the level of integration andinter-dependencies across the systems.During theyear we obtained an understandingof relevant controlsover the informationsystems thatare important tofinancialreporting,includingthe changes made as part ofthe Group’s IT remediationprogramme. We evaluated the design andimplementation of controls whichmanagement has remediated andtested theiroperatingeffectiveness.We alsoperformed testing of certain automated controls, particularlythose which are underpinned by remediated IT systems and others that were determined to be key.Weobtained an understanding of relevant manual controls, evaluating their design and implementationand, in certain cases, testing theoperating effectiveness of those controls which relate to identified deficiencies. Consistent with the prior year we also extended the scope ofour substantive audit procedures in response to the deficiencies which affected the applications and databases within the scopeof our audit.Key observationsBased on thecurrent work programme,management anticipates thatmuch of itsremediation planwill be completed in 2024/25 withtheremainder completed by2025/26. Our audit plan includes an ongoing programme to test the Group’s remediated IT controls relevant to theaudit oncethis has been completed by management.We considerthe level ofrisk associated with thiskey auditmatter has reduced from theprior yeardue to thecontinued progress made by managementduring thecurrent year.Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024122.Financial statements\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf7d ---\n","6. Our application of materiality6.1. MaterialityWedefine materiality as themagnitude ofmisstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economicdecisions ofa reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work andin evaluating the results of our work.Based on ourprofessional judgement,we determined materiality forthe financial statements as a whole as follows:Group financialstatementsParentCompany financial statementsMateriality£115m (2022/23: £100m)£86.25m (2022/23: £75m)Basis fordeterminingmateriality4.92% (2022/23: 4.64%) of total adjusted profit before tax, from bothcontinuing and discontinued operations, (including net pension financeincome/(cost)) of £2,337m (2022/23: £2,156m).Materiality represents less than 1% of net assets(2022/23: less than 1%) of net assets.Rationalefor thebenchmarkappliedWe have determined materiality based on 4.92% of total adjusted profitbefore tax, fromboth continuing and discontinued operations,(including net pension financeincome/(cost)). Adjusting items aredefined inNote 1and include net pension finance income/ (cost). Forthe purpose of our materiality determination we have excluded themfrom adjusting items and therefore increased/ (reduced) adjustedprofit before tax accordingly. Our determined materiality represents0.17% (2022/23: 0.15%) of the Group’s revenue from continuingoperations and 1.0% (2022/23: 0.8%) of net assets.RefertoNote4(Adjusting items) for further details of adjusting itemsand management’s reconciliationof thisalternative performancemeasure to the Group’s statutory measure.As this is the Parent Company of the Group, itdoes not generate significant revenues otherthan investment returns, but incurs costs.Net assets are of most relevance to users of thefinancial statements.ComponentmaterialityThe work performed on components identified in our Group auditscope (excluding the Parent Company) was completed to a componentmateriality level between £11m and £56m (2022/23: £10m and £49m).Groupmateriality£115mComponentmaterialityrange£11m to £56mAudit Committee reportingthreshold£5.75mAdjusted profit beforetax from continuing anddiscontinued operations(including net pension financeincome/cost)£2,337m6.2. Performance materialityWe set performance materiality at a level lower than materiality to reduce the probability that, in aggregate, uncorrected andundetectedmisstatements exceed themateriality for the financial statements asa whole.Group financialstatementsParentCompany financialstatementsPerformancemateriality65% (2022/23: 65%) of Group materiality65% (2022/23: 65%) of Parent CompanymaterialityBasis andrationale fordeterminingperformancematerialityAs we continue to be unable to rely on internal controls in the retail business, consistent with previous years, we have used alower percentage of materiality to determine our performance materiality for 2023/24. In determining our performancemateriality, we have also considered the nature, quantum and volume of corrected and uncorrected misstatementsin priorperiods, including prior perioderrors, andour expectation thatmisstatements from prior periods wouldnot likely recur inthe current period.6.3. Error reporting thresholdWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £5.75m (2022/23: £5m), aswell as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the AuditCommittee ondisclosurematters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024123.GovernanceAdditional informationFinancial statementsStrategic report\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf7e ---\n","Financial statements continuedIndependent auditor’s report to the members of Tesco PLC continued7. An overview of the scope of our audit7.1. Identification andscoping of componentsOur Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of theGroup and its environment, including Group-wide controls, andassessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. TheGroup has subsidiary grocery retail operations in five countries,together with interests in a number of other businesses both in theUK and internationally.The Group’s accounting processis structured around businessunits managed by local finance functions and further supported bybusiness service centres in Bengaluru, India and Budapest, Hungarywhich provide accounting and administrative support for theGroup’s core retail operations. Each local finance function reportsthrough to the central Group finance function based at the Group’shead office.Based on our assessment of the Group, we focused our Groupaudit scope primarily on the audit work on six significant retaillocations (UK, Booker, Republic of Ireland, Czech Republic, Hungaryand Slovakia) and Tesco Bank. The operations in Czech Republic,Hungary and Slovakia are managed as one combined business. Weperformed a detailedscoping exercise overall these componentsto determine which individual entities and account balances wouldbe subject to full scope or specified scope audits the latter beingwhere only the keyfinancial statement account balanceswereincluded in scope. For entities and account balances not subject tofull or specified audit procedures we performed analytical reviewprocedures to confirm our conclusion that there was no significantrisk of material misstatement in the residual population. Theentities which were either in full or specified audit scope in thecurrent year represent 97% (2022/23: 97%) of revenue fromcontinuing operations, 92% (2022/23: 93%) of operating profit fromcontinuing operations and 92% (2022/23: 96%) of total assets. Inrelationto discontinued operations weperformed fullscope auditprocedures covering 100% of revenue and operating profit as wellas 100% of total assets of the disposal group and non-currentassets heldfor sale.In addition, we performed analytical review procedures for twoother businesses (dunnhumby and OneStop), where the extent ofour testing was based on our assessment of the risks of materialmisstatement and of the size of the Group’s operations at theselocations.As each of the local finance functions maintains separate financialrecords, we engaged component auditors from the Deloittemember firms in the UK, Republic of Ireland and Central Europe toperform procedures at all the wholly-owned components underour direction and supervision. This approach also allowed us toengage local auditors who have appropriate knowledge of localregulations to perform the audit work, under a common Deloitteaudit approach.The components within full or specified scope contribute theproportions of Group totals shown below.Revenue from continuing operations3%97%Full or specified audit scopeReview at Group levelProfit before tax from continuing operations8%92%Full or specified audit scopeReview at Group levelTotal assets8%92%Full or specified audit scopeReview at Group levelAt the Group level we also tested the consolidation process andcarried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion thatthere were no significant risks of material misstatement of theaggregated financial information of the remaining components notsubject to full scope or specified scope audits. At a Group level wealso performed audit procedureson centrally heldbalancesincluding treasury, post-employment benefit obligations, headoffice costs and litigation and claims.The most significant component of the Group is its retail businessin the UK. As such, there is extensive interaction between theGroup and the UK audit team to allow appropriate level of directionand supervision in this audit work. During the course of our audit,the UK audit team visited 27 (2022/23: 26) retail stores in the UK toattend inventory counts and to complete store control testingprocedures, and 7 (2022/23: 8) distribution centre inventorycounts.7.2. Our consideration of the control environmentIn the current year our controls approach was principally designedto inform our risk assessment, to allow us to test the operatingeffectiveness of certain relevant controls, to test controls thataddress risks of material misstatement for which substantiveprocedures alone would not provide sufficient appropriate auditevidence and to test the operating effectiveness of controls withinprocesses where a controls reliance approach was taken. As notedonpage 122it is not possible to take a control reliant auditapproach in the retail businesses due to the IT deficiencies. Inaddition Tesco Bank has separate information systems wherethesame IT deficiencies do not exist and therefore a controls reliantaudit approach was taken as planned.The Group’s operations utilise a range of information systemswhich underpin the financial reporting process. These are largelyconsistent across the retail business, however, Tesco Bank hasseparate information systems due to the nature of the business.For all of the components that were subject to full scope audits, weobtained an understanding of the relevant IT systems for thepurpose of our audit work.In previous years we reported deficiencies in certain IT controls. Asdescribed in the Audit Committee Report onpage 85,management has implemented a remediation plan, progressagainst which is monitored. Accordingly, consistent with the prioryear, we extended the scope of our substantive audit procedures inresponseto the identified deficiencies.Further details are set out in the‘Retail technologyenvironment’key audit matter in section 5.6 above.Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024124.Financial statements\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf7f ---\n","7.3. Ourconsideration of climate-related risksThe Group is exposed to the impacts of climate change on itsbusiness and operations as highlighted in the Task Force onClimate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report onpage 39,the viability statement onpage 46, the principal risks onpage 30,and inNote 14of thefinancial statements. TheGroup has set outtheir key commitments to reduce Scope 1 and 2 market basedemissions by 2025, be carbon neutral across their own operationsby 2035 and achieve net zero across their value chain (Scope 3) by2050.We engaged with both the central finance and sustainabilityfunctions to gain an understanding of the assessment of, and theprocess undertaken to both identify and quantify, the Group’sclimate-related risks. We engaged our climate specialists in ourassessment to consider broader industry and market-wide practice.Wecompleted an independent climate-based risk assessment inorder to consider the potential impact of climate change on theGroup’sfinancial statements, incorporating both business specificknowledge and wider industry awareness, including the extent towhich the impact has been included in the Group’s forecastfinancial information. We used this to assess the completeness ofthe Group’s identified risks and to develop audit procedures torespond to these risks, in particular as part of our work in relationto store impairment and long-term viability, as well as consideringclimate-related risks throughout our risk assessments on eachfinancial statement accountbalance. Further details of our work inrelation to store impairment are set out in the ‘Store impairmentreview’ key audit matter in section 5.1 above.In consultation with our climate change specialists we consideredthe impactof management’s review of the food wasteprocess. Thisreview had highlighted that food which management believed wasbeing processed for animal feed was in fact going to anaerobicdigestion and the Group subsequently terminated the relationshipwith the food waste processor in the UK. Although not subject toaudit, we have considered whether management’s disclosuresreflect our understanding of the impact on the food waste metricand did not identify any material inconsistencies as a result of theseprocedures. Management’s discussion ofthis isset out in theDirectors Remuneration Report onpage 90.In considering the disclosures presented as part of the StrategicReport, we engaged our climate specialists to assess compliancewith the TCFD requirements and the recommendations made byboth the Task Force and FRC as set out in their thematic reviews.We also assessed whether these disclosures reflect ourunderstanding of the Group’s approach to climate and did notidentify any material inconsistencies as a result of theseprocedures.7.4. Working with other auditorsThe Group audit team issued detailed instructions to thecomponent auditors and visited the component auditors for eachof the six significant locations set out above, in addition to TescoBank and the Group’s business service centre in Bengaluru. We hada dedicated audit partner focused on overseeing the role of thecomponent audit teams, so that we applied a consistent auditapproach to the operations in the Group’s UK and internationalbusinesses.The audit visits by the Group audit team were timed to enable us tobe involved during the planning and risk assessment process inaddition to the execution of detailed audit procedures. During ourvisitswe attended key meetingswith component management andauditors, and reviewed and challenged detailed component auditorworking papers in the underlying audit files and componentreporting. In addition, we attended component audit closing callsand held regular remote communication to interact on any relatedaudit and accounting matters which arose.Additionally, the component auditteams attended twoall-dayplanning meetings in July 2023 led by the Group audit team andheld prior to commencement of our detailed audit work. Thepurpose of these planning meetings was to establish a good level ofunderstanding of the Group’s businesses, its core strategy and holda discussion of the significant risks and workshops on our plannedaudit approach. Group management also attended part of themeeting to support these planning activities.8. Other informationThe other information comprises the information included in theAnnual Report, other thanthe financial statements and ourauditor’s report thereon. The Directors are responsible for theother information contained within the annual report.Our opinion on the financialstatements does not cover theotherinformation and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated inour report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusionthereon.Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so,consider whether the other information is materially inconsistentwith the financial statementsor our knowledge obtained in thecourse of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materiallymisstated.If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent materialmisstatements, we are required to determine whether this givesrise to a material misstatement in the financial statementsthemselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we concludethat there is a materialmisstatement of this other information, weare required to report that fact.We have nothing to report in this regard.9. Responsibilities of directorsAs explainedmore fullyin the Directors’ responsibilitiesstatement,the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financialstatements and forbeing satisfied that theygive a true and fairview, and for such internal control as the Directors determine isnecessary toenable the preparationof financial statements thatare free frommaterial misstatement, whether due tofraud orerror.In preparing the financialstatements,the Directorsare responsiblefor assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability tocontinue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable mattersrelated to going concern and using the going concern basis ofaccounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate theGroup or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have norealistic alternative but to do so.10. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of thefinancial statementsOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whetherthe financialstatements asa whole are free frommaterialmisstatement, whetherdue to fraud or error, and toissue anauditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance isa high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an auditconducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect amaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise fromfraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in theaggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence theeconomic decisions of users taken on thebasis of these financialstatements.A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of thefinancial statements islocated on the FRC’s website at:www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

Extent to which the audit was consideredcapable of detecting irregularities, including fraudIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance withlaws and regulations. We design procedures in line with ourresponsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatementsin respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which ourprocedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraudis detailed below.11.1. Identifying and assessing potential risks related toirregularitiesIn identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement inrespect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance withlaws and regulations, we considered the following:—the nature of the industry and sector, control environment andbusiness performance including the design of the Group’sremuneration policies, key drivers for Directors’ remuneration,bonus levels and performance targets;—the Group’s own assessment of the risks that irregularities mayoccur either as a result of fraud or error;—results of ourenquiries ofmanagement, internalaudit function,the Group’s Security function and the Group’s ComplianceOfficer, the Group’s General Counsel and the Audit Committeeabout their own identification and assessment of the risks ofirregularities, including those that are specific to the sector;—anymatters weidentified havingobtained and reviewed theGroup’s documentation of their policies and proceduresrelating to:—identifying, evaluating and complying with laws andregulations and whether they were aware of any instancesof non-compliance;—detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whetherthey have knowledge of any actual, suspected or allegedfraud;—the internal controls established to mitigate risks of fraud ornon-compliance with laws and regulations including theGroup’s controls relating to the Group’s ongoing compliancewith the Groceries Supply Code of Practice (GSCOP)requirements and the requirements of theUnited Kingdom’sPrudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial ConductAuthority (FCA) in relation to Tesco Bank; and—the matters discussed among the auditengagement teamincluding significant component audit teams and relevantinternal specialists, including IT, tax, valuations, pensionsactuarialspecialists, and industry specialistsregarding how andwhere fraud mightoccur in the financial statements and anypotential indicators of fraud.As a result of these procedures, we considered the opportunitiesand incentives that may exist within the organisation for fraud andidentified the greatest potential for fraud in the following areas:Tesco Bank loanimpairment, and recognition of commercialincome. In common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are alsorequired to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk ofmanagement override.We also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatoryframeworks that the Group operates in, focusing on provisions ofthose laws and regulations that had a direct effect on thedetermination of material amounts and disclosures in the financialstatements. The key laws andregulationswe considered in thiscontext included the Group’s ongoing compliance with the GSCOP,UK Companies Act, Listing Rules, pensions legislation and taxlegislation.In addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulationsthat do not have a direct effect on the financial statements butcompliance with which may be fundamental to the Group’s abilityto operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included theGroup’s requirements of theUnited Kingdom’s PRA, FCA andSolvency II regulations in relation to Tesco Bank, employment law,health and safety and food safety laws and regulations.11.2 Audit response to risks identifiedAs a result of performing the above, we identified Tesco Bank loanimpairmentand recognition of commercial income as key auditmatters related to the potential risk of fraud. The key audit matterssection of our report explains the matters in more detail and alsodescribes the specific procedures we performed in response tothose key audit matters.In addition to the above, our procedures to respond to risksidentified included the following:—reviewing the financialstatement disclosures andtesting tosupporting documentation to assesscompliance with provisionsof relevant laws and regulations described as having a directeffect on thefinancialstatements;—enquiring of management,the Audit Committeeand in-houseand external legal counsel concerning actual and potentiallitigation and claims;—performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual orunexpected relationships that may indicate risks of materialmisstatement due to fraud;—reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance,reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence,if any, with HMRC and other relevant regulatory bodies;—considering the impact of fraud in the food waste metrichighlighted onpage 85of the Annual Report on the financialstatements and whether there is any indicationfor furtherfraud or potential for inappropriate disclosure in the financialstatements; and—in addressing the risk of fraud through management override ofcontrols, testing the appropriateness of journal entries andother adjustments; assessing whetherthe judgements made inmaking accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias;and evaluating the business rationale of any significanttransactions that are unusual or outside the normal course ofbusiness.We also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations andpotential fraud risks toall engagement team members includinginternal specialists and significant component audit teams, andremained alert toany indications of fraud or non-compliance withlaws and regulations throughout the audit.Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024126.Financial statements\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf81 ---\n","12.

The address of the registeredoffice isTesco House, Shire Park, Kestrel Way, Welwyn Garden City,AL71GA, UK.The main activities of the Companyand its subsidiaries (together, theGroup) are those of retailing, retail banking and insurance services.Basis of preparationThe consolidated Group financial statements have been prepared inaccordance with UK-adopted IFRS.The consolidated Group financialstatements are presented in Pounds Sterling, generally rounded tothe nearest million.They are prepared on the historical cost basis,except for certain financial instruments, share-based payments andpension assets that have been measured at fair value.The Directors have, at the time of approving the financialstatements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and theGroup have adequate resources to continue in operational existencefor the foreseeable future, which reflects a period of 18 monthsfrom the date of approval of the financial statements and haveconcluded that there are no material uncertainties relating to goingconcern. Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis ofaccounting inpreparing the consolidated Group financialstatements. The scenarios considered as part of the going concernassessment are consistent with those used in the Longer-termviability statement. Further information onthe Group’s strongliquidity position is given in the Financial review, Summary of totalindebtedness section, and information on committed facilities isprovided in Note 27.Unless otherwise stated, the accounting policies set out belowhavebeen applied consistently to all periods presented in theseconsolidated Group financial statements.IFRS 17 ‘Insurance contracts’ is effective for the accounting periodcommencing 26 February 2023. IFRS 17 has been applied fullyretrospectively and comparatives for prior periods have beenrestated from a transition date of 27 February 2022. Refer toNote33 for further details.Other standards, interpretations and amendments effective inthecurrent financial year have not had a material impact on theconsolidated Group financial statements.The Group has not applied any standards, interpretationsoramendments that have been issued but are not yeteffective.The impact of the following is under assessment:-IFRS 18 ‘Primary financial statements’, which will become effectivein the consolidated Group financial statements for the financialyear ending 26 February 2028, subject to UK endorsement.Other standards, interpretations and amendments issued but notyet effective are not expected to have a material impact on theconsolidated Group financial statements.Discontinued operationsDuring the year, the Board approved a plan to dispose of the Group’sregulated Banking operations, which form a major part of theTesco Bank segment. The net results of the Banking operations arepresented as a discontinued operation in the Group incomestatement, for which the comparatives have been restated. Theassets and liabilities of the Banking operations disposal group arepresented separately in the Group balance sheet as held for sale.For further details, refer to Note 7.Basis of consolidationThe consolidated Group financial statements consist of the financialstatements of the ultimate Parent Company (Tesco PLC), all entitiescontrolled by the Company (its subsidiaries) and the Group’s shareofitsinterests in joint ventures and associates, accounted for usingthe equity method.The financial year represents the 52 weeks ended 24 February 2024(priorfinancial year 52 weeks ended 25 February 2023). For theUKand the Republic of Ireland (UK & ROI), the results are for the52weeks ended 24 February 2024 (prior financial year 52 weeksended 25 February 2023). For all other operations, the results arefor the calendar year ended 29February 2024 (prior calendar yearended 28February 2023).RevenueRevenue is income arising from the sale of goods and services in theordinary course of the Group’s activities, net of value added taxes.Revenue is recognised when performance obligations are satisfiedand control has transferred to the customer. For the majority ofrevenue streams, there is a low level of judgement applied indetermining the transaction price or the timing of transferofcontrol.Revenue from sale of goods and servicesSale of goodsThe sale of goods represents the vast majority of the Group’srevenue. For goods sold in store and fuel, revenue is recognised atthe point of sale. For online or wholesale sales of goods, revenue isrecognised on collection by, or delivery to, the customer. Revenueisreduced by a provision for expected returns (refund liability).Anasset and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales isrecognised for the Group’s right to recover goods from customers.Clubcard (customer loyalty programme)Clubcard points issued by Tesco when a customer purchases goodsare aseparate performance obligation providing a material right toafuture discount. The total transaction price (sales price of goods)isallocated tothe Clubcard points and the goods sold based ontheirrelative standalone selling prices, with the Clubcard points’standalone price based on the value of the points to the customer,adjusted for expected redemptionrates (breakage). The amountallocated to Clubcard points is deferred as a contract liability withintrade and other payables.Revenue is recognised as the points are redeemed by the customer.Revenue related to breakage is recognised in line with redemptions,subject to the variable consideration constraint (i.e. provided itishighly probable not to result in a significant reversal of thecumulative revenue recognised), with the remainder recognisedonexpiry of the points.Data science servicesThe Group generates revenue from the provision of consultancyservices (customer data science and analytics), software accessandmedia services through its data science business dunnhumby.Revenue is recognised either over time or at a point in time, withalow level of judgement typically required to determine thetransaction price or timing of transfer of benefit to the customer.The Group recognises revenue over time if the customersimultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided as theservice is performed; or performance of the service does not createan asset with an alternative use and the Group has an enforceableright to payment for work to date. For services performed over time,revenue is recognised based on progress in fulfilling the serviceunless it is provided on a ‘stand-ready’ basis, in which case revenueis recognised over the period the service is expected to be utilised.Revenue recognised at a point in time is recognised when therelevant performance obligation is satisfied.Money services and similar incomeThe majority of the fees in respect of money services (includingATMs, travel money and gift cards) are recognised at the point intime at which the transaction with the customer takes place andtheservice is performed. For services performed over time,payment is generally due monthly in line with the satisfactionofperformance obligations.Tesco Bank interest income on retained financial assets thatare measured at amortised cost and fair value through othercomprehensive income is determined using the effective interestrate method. Calculation of the effective interest rate takes intoaccount fees receivable that are an integral part of the instrument’syield and premiums or discounts on acquisition or issue.Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024134.Financial statements\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf89 ---\n","The Group generates commission income from the sale of whitelabel petand travel insurance products underwritten by third-partyproviders, which is recognised on a net basis as such policies aresold. This is based on commission rates which are independent ofthe profitability of underlying insurance policies. The Group alsorecognises commission income from certain policy renewals at thepoint these policies are sold.This is when the Group has satisfied all of its performanceobligations inrelation to the policy sold and it is considered highlyprobable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenuerecognised will not occur infuture periods. This calculation takesinto account both estimates of future renewal volumes and renewalcommission rates. A contract asset isrecognised in relation to thisrevenue. This is unwound over the remainder of the contract withthe customer, in this case being the third-party insurance provider.The end policyholders have the right to cancel an insurance policyatany time. Therefore, a contract liability is recognised for theamount of any expected refundsdue and the revenue recognised inrelation to these sales is reduced accordingly. This contract refundliability isestimated using prior experience of customer refunds.Theappropriateness of the assumptions used in this calculationisreassessed at each reporting date.Insurance revenueInsurance revenue relates to motor and home insurance policiesunderwritten by the Group’s subsidiary, Tesco Underwriting Limited.Refer to the Insurance section below.Commercial incomeConsistent with standard industry practice, the Group hasagreements with suppliers whereby volume-related allowances,promotional and marketing allowances and various other fees anddiscounts are received in connection with the purchase of goodsforresale from those suppliers. Most of the income received fromsuppliers relates to adjustments to acore cost price of a product,and as such is considered part of the purchase price for thatproduct. Sometimes receipt of the income is conditional on theGroup performing specified actions or satisfying certainperformance conditions associated with the purchase of theproduct. These include achieving agreed purchases or sales volumetargets and providing promotionalor marketing materials andactivitiesorpromotional product positioning. While there is nostandardindustry definition, these amounts receivable fromsuppliers inconnection withthe purchase of goods for resale aregenerally termedcommercial income.Commercial income is recognised when earned by the Group, whichoccurs when all obligations conditional for earning income have beendischarged, and the income can be measured reliably based on theterms of the contract. The income is recognised as a credit withincost of sales. Where the income earned relates to inventories whichare held by the Group at the reporting date, the income is includedwithin the cost of those inventories and recognised in cost of salesupon sale of those inventories.Finance incomeFinance income isrecognised in the period to which it relates usingthe effective interest rate method.Finance costsBorrowing costs are recognised in the Group income statementin the period in which they occur using the effective interestrate method.Business combinations and goodwillThe Group accounts for all business combinations by applying theacquisition method. All acquisition-related costs are expensed.On acquisition, the assets (including intangible assets), liabilities andcontingent liabilities of an acquired business are measured at theirfairvalues. Non-controlling interests are stated at the non-controlling interests’ proportion of the fair values of the assets andliabilities recognised.Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of theconsideration transferred over the net fair value of the Group’sshare ofthe net assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of anacquired business, subsidiary, joint venture or associate and thefairvalue of the non-controlling interest in the acquiree. If theconsideration is less than the fair value of the Group’s share ofthenet assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiredbusiness (i.e. a bargain purchase), thedifference is credited to theGroup income statement in the period ofacquisition.At the acquisition date, goodwill is recognised as an asset andis allocated to each of the cash-generating units or groupsof cash-generating units expected to benefit from the businesscombination’s synergies and to the lowest level at whichmanagement monitors the goodwill. Goodwill arising on theacquisition of joint ventures and associates is included within thecarrying value of the investment. When disposing of or reorganisingpart of a cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating unitstowhich goodwill has been allocated, the goodwill is reallocatedbetween the affected operations onthe basis of their relativevalues. On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, theattributable amount of goodwill isincluded in the determination ofthe profit or loss on disposal.Cloud software licence agreementsLicence agreements to use cloud software are treated as servicecontracts and expensed in the Group income statement, unlesstheGroup has both a contractual right to take possession of thesoftware at any time without significant penalty, and the ability to runthe software independently of the host vendor. In such cases thelicence agreement is capitalised as software within intangible assets.Costs to configure or customise a cloud software licence areexpensed alongside the related service contract in the Groupincome statement, unless they create a separately identifiableresource controlled by the Group, in which case they are capitalised.Intangible assetsIntangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost lessaccumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.Theyareamortised on a straight-line basis over their estimateduseful lives of three to 10 years for software and up to 10 years forcustomer relationships. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives,such as pharmacy licences, are not amortised.Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditureincurred on an individual project is capitalised only ifspecific criteriaare met.Property, plant and equipmentProperty, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulateddepreciation and any recognised impairment in value. Property, plantand equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis to its residualvalue over its anticipated useful economic life:freehold buildings – 10 to 40 years; andfixtures and fittings, office equipment, and motor vehicles – threeto 20 years.Impairment of non-financial assetsGoodwill is reviewed for impairmentat least annually by assessingthe recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit, or group ofcash-generating units, to which the goodwill relates. For all othernon-financial assets, the Group performs impairment testing wherethere are indicators of impairment. Where the asset does notgenerate cash flows that are independent from other assets, theGroup estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generatingunit to which the asset belongs. When the recoverable amount isless than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognisedimmediately in the Group income statement.Goodwill impairments are not subsequently reversed. Where animpairment loss on other non-financial assets subsequentlyreverses, thecarrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit)is increased tothe revised estimate ofthe recoverable amount, butso that the increased carrying amount does not exceedthe carryingamount that would have been determined if noimpairment loss hadbeen recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prioryears. A reversal of an impairmentloss is recognised immediately asa credit to the Group income statement.Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024135.GovernanceAdditional informationFinancial statementsStrategic report\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf8a ---\n","Notes to the Group financial statementscontinuedNote 1 Accounting policies, judgementsandestimatescontinuedInventoriesInventories comprise goods and development properties held forresale. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisablevalue using the weighted average cost basis.Cash and cash equivalentsCash and cash equivalents in the Group balance sheet consist ofcash at bank and on hand, credit and debit card receivables,demand deposits with banks and short-term highly liquidinvestments with an original maturity of three months or less,forexample short-term deposits, loans and advances to banks,commercial paper and certificates of deposit. Cash and cashequivalents in the Group cash flow statement also include overdraftsrepayable on demand as they form an integral part of the Group’scash management.Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operationsNon-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets heldfor sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principallythrough a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable.They are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair valueless costs to sell, with the exception of assets which are scoped outof the measurement requirements of IFRS 5 ‘Non-current assetsheld for sale and discontinued operations’, for example financialassets, which continue to be measured in accordance with IFRS 9‘Financial instruments’.Where the carrying amount of a non-current asset or disposalgroupheldfor sale exceeds its fair value less costs to sell, a loss isrecognised. This is allocated firstly against any goodwill attributableto the disposal group, and then to other non-current assets inthedisposal group that are in scope of IFRS 5’s measurementrequirements. Any excess loss remaining is recognised against theremaining assets of the disposal groupas a whole.A component of the Group that is held for sale or disposed of ispresented as a discontinued operation either when it is a subsidiaryacquired exclusively with a view to resale; or it represents, or is partofacoordinated plan to dispose of, a separate major line of businessorgeographical area of operations.The net results of discontinuedoperations are presented separately in the Group income statement(andthe comparatives restated).LeasesThe Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease atinception of the contract.The Group as a lesseeA right of use asset and corresponding lease liability are recognisedat commencement of the lease.The lease liability is measured at the present value of the leasepayments, discounted at the rate implicit in the lease, or if thatcannot be readily determined, at the lessee’s incrementalborrowingrate specific to the term, country, currency and startdateof the lease.The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost usingthe effective interest rate method. It is remeasured, with acorresponding adjustment to the right of use asset, when thereisachange in future lease payments resulting from a rent review,change in an index or rate such as inflation, or change in the Group’sassessment of whether it is reasonably certain to exerciseapurchase, extension or break option.The right of use asset is initially measured at cost, comprising: theinitial lease liability; any lease payments already made less any leaseincentives received; initial direct costs; and any dilapidation orrestoration costs. Theright of use asset is subsequently depreciatedon a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or theuseful life of the underlying asset, and tested for impairment.Leases of low value assets (value when new less than £5,000) andshort-term leases of 12 months or less are expensed to the Groupincome statement, as are variable payments dependent onperformance or usage, ‘out of contract’ payments and non-leaseservice components.The Group as a lessorLeases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of thelease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownershiptothe lessee. All other leases areclassified as operating leases, forwhich rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over theterm of the lease.Sale and leasebackWhere the Group sells an asset and immediately reacquires use of itby entering into a lease with the buyer, a lease liability is recognised,the associated property, plant andequipment asset is derecognised,and a right of use asset is recognised at the proportion of thecarrying value relating to the right retained. Any gain or loss arisingrelates to the rights transferred to the buyer.In the cash flow statement, sale and leaseback proceeds receivedare classified as investing cash flows, unless the proceeds exceedthe fair value of the asset sold, in which case the excess proceedsare classified as financing cash flows.Property buybacksA property buyback is where a property that is currently leased isbought back from the landlord. Property buybacks that are a directpurchase of the underlying asset, outside of a corporate wrapper,are viewed as the modification of the lease to include a purchaseoption, followed by theimmediate exercise ofthat purchase option.The lease liability is settled and the right of use asset forms partofthe cost of the property, plant and equipment acquired, andnogain or loss is recognised in the income statement from theproperty buyback.Property buybacks inside a corporate wrapper (such as a specialpurpose vehicle or joint venture structure) that do not meet thedefinition of a business combination are asset acquisitions. The costof the asset acquisition includes thecash consideration paid and thecarrying values of pre-existing lease contracts and any previouslyheld interests. No gain or loss is recognised in the income statementfrom the property buyback.In the cash flow statement, property buyback net proceeds paid areclassified as investing cash flows, unless the proceeds exceed theincremental asset purchased (difference between property, plantand equipment recognised and right of use asset derecognised),inwhich casethe excess proceeds are classified as financingcashflows.Post-employment obligationsFor defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discountedpresent value and plan assets are recorded at fair value.The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognisedseparately in the Group income statement. Service costs are spreadsystematically over the expected service lives of employees andfinancing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Groupstatement of comprehensive income/(loss).Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as anexpense as they fall due.TaxationThe tax expense included in the Group income statement consists ofcurrent and deferred tax.Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income forthe financial year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enactedby the balance sheet date.Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method,providing for temporary differences between the carrying amountsof assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and theamounts used for taxation purposes.Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to applyin the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, basedon the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted bythe balance sheet date.Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024136.Financial statements\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf8b ---\n","The tax expense is recognised in the Group income statement, exceptwhen it relates toitems recognised directly in the Group statementof changes in equity or the Group statement of comprehensiveincome/(loss), in which case the tax follows the same treatment.Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probablethat taxable profits will be available against which deductibletemporary differences can be utilised.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each otherwhenthere is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assetsagainst current tax liabilities and they relate to income taxes leviedby the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity ordifferent taxable entities which intend to settle current tax assetsand liabilities on a netbasis.Tax provisions are recognised for uncertain tax positions where ariskof an additional tax liability has been identified and it is probablethat the Group will be required to settle that tax. Measurement isdependent on management’s expectation of theoutcome ofdecisions by tax authorities in the various tax jurisdictions in whichthe Group operates. This is assessed on a case-by-case basis usingin-house tax experts, professional firms, and previous experience.Refer to Note 6.Foreign currenciesAt each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that aredenominated in foreign currencies are retranslated to the functionalcurrency at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchangedifferences are recognised in the Group income statement in theperiod in which they arise, apart from exchange differences ontransactions entered into to hedge certain foreign currency risks,and exchange differences on monetary items forming part of thenetinvestment inaforeign operation.The assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations aretranslated into Pounds Sterling at exchange rates prevailing at thebalance sheet date. Profits and losses are translated at averageexchange rates for the relevant accounting periods. Exchangedifferences arising are recognised in the Group statement ofcomprehensive income/(loss)and are included in the Group’stranslation reserve. Such translation differences are recognisedasincome or expenses in the period in which the operation isdisposed of.Financial instrumentsFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groupbalance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractualprovisions of the instrument. Classification and subsequentremeasurement depends on the Group’s business model formanaging the financial asset and its cash flow characteristics.Financial assets thatare held for collection of contractual cashflows, where those cash flows represent solely payments of principaland interest, are measured at amortised cost, and all other financialassets are measured either at fair value through profit or loss or fairvalue through other comprehensive income.Trade receivablesTrade receivables are non interest-bearing and are recognisedinitially at fair value, or at transaction price if there is not a significantfinancing component. They are subsequently held at amortised costusing the effective interest rate method, less allowance for ECLs.InvestmentsInvestments in debt instruments atamortised cost are measured atamortised cost, using the effective interest rate method lessallowance for ECLs.Gains and losses on investments in debt instruments held at fairvalue through other comprehensive income are recogniseddirectlyin other comprehensive income, except for impairmentgains andlosses, interest income, and foreign exchange gains andlosses, which are recognised in the Group income statement.Whenthe debt instrument is derecognised, cumulative amountsinother comprehensive incomeare reclassified to the Groupincome statement.Investments in equity instruments have been irrevocably designatedat fair value through other comprehensive income.Property fund and other investments held at fair value throughprofitor loss are measured at fair value, with changes in fair valuerecognised in the Group income statement.Short-term investmentsShort-term investments are liquid financial assets which have anoriginal maturity of 12 months orless. Short-term investments aretypically readilyavailable for conversion to cash, but do not meet thecriteria forclassification as cash equivalents because either theirmaturity is greater than three months, for example short-termdeposits, reverse repurchase agreements, commercial paper, andcertificates of deposit, or the risk of changes in value is more thaninsignificant, for example money market funds.Loans and advances to customersLoans and advances are initially recognised at fair value plus directlyrelated transaction costs. Subsequently, they are carried atamortised cost using the effective interest method, less anyallowance for ECLs.Impairment of financial assetsThe Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the ECLs associatedwithits financial assets carried at amortised cost and debtinstruments carried at fair value through other comprehensiveincome. The ECLs are updated at each reporting date to reflectchanges in credit risk.The three-stage model for impairment has been applied to loansandadvances to customers, investments in debt instruments atamortised cost, investments in debt instruments at fair valuethrough other comprehensive income, short-term investments, andloan receivables from joint ventures and associates. The credit riskisdetermined throughmodelling a range of possible outcomesfordifferent loss scenarios, usingreasonable and supportableinformation about pastevents, currentconditions and forecastsoffuture events and economic conditions and taking into accountthe time value of money. A12-month ECL is recognised, unless thecredit risk on the financial assetincreases significantly after initialrecognition, when the lifetime ECLis recognised. The expectedlifetime of a financial asset is generally the contractual term.For trade receivables, contract assets, and lease receivables, theGroupapplies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, withlifetime ECLs recognised from initial recognition of thereceivable.These assets are grouped, based onshared credit riskcharacteristics and days past due, with ECLsfor each groupingdetermined based on the Group’s historicalcredit loss experience,adjusted for factors specific toeach receivable, general economicconditions, and expected changes in forecast conditions.Interest-bearing borrowingsInterest-bearing borrowings and overdrafts are initially recorded atfairvalue, net of attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initialrecognition, interest-bearing borrowings are held at amortised costwith any difference between proceeds and redemption value beingrecognised in the Group income statement over the period of theborrowings on an effective interest basis.Trade payablesTrade payables are non interest-bearing and are recognised initiallyat fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using theeffective interest method.Equity instrumentsEquity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at theproceeds received, net of direct issue costs.Derivative financial instruments and hedge accountingThe Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge itsexposure to foreign exchange, inflation, interest rate, and commodityrisks arising from operating, financing, and investing activities.Derivative financial instruments are recognised and stated at fairvalue. Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, anygains or losses on remeasurementare immediately recognised intheGroup income statement. Where derivatives qualify for hedgeaccounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on thenature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged.Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024137.GovernanceAdditional informationFinancial statementsStrategic report\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf8c ---\n","Notes to the Group financial statementscontinuedNote 1 Accounting policies, judgementsandestimatescontinuedAs permitted under IFRS 9, the Group has elected to continuetoapply the existing hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39‘Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement’ for itsportfolio fair value hedging of interest rate risk.Fair value hedgingDerivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedgeswhen they hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in the fair valueof a recognised asset or liability. Changes in the fair value ofderivatives that are designated as fair value hedges are recognisedinthe Group income statement within finance income or costs,together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item thatisattributable to the hedged risk.If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, theadjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item is amortised tothe Group income statement over the remaining period to maturity.Cash flow hedgingDerivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedgeswhen they hedge the Group’s exposure to variability in cash flowsthat is either attributable toa particular risk associated witharecognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasttransaction. The effective element of any gain or loss fromremeasuring the derivative designated as the hedging instrumentisrecognised directly in other comprehensive income andaccumulated in the hedging reserve. The ineffective element isrecognised immediately in the Group income statement.Where the hedged item subsequently results in the recognition of anon-financial asset such as inventory, the amounts accumulated inthe hedging reserve and cost of hedging reserve are included in theinitial cost of the asset. For all other cash flow hedges, the amountsaccumulated are recognised in the Group income statement whenthe hedged item or transaction affects the Group income statement.Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrumentexpires or is sold, terminated or exercised or no longer meets theGroup’s risk management objective. The cumulative gain or loss inthe hedging reserve and cost of hedging reserve remains until theforecast transaction occurs or the original hedged item affects theGroup income statement.If a forecast hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, thecumulative gain or loss in the hedging reserve and cost of hedgingreserve is reclassified to the Group income statement.Net investment hedgingFinancial instruments are classified as net investment hedges whenthey hedge the Group’s net investment in an overseas operation.Theeffective element of any foreign exchange gain or loss fromremeasuring the instrument is recognised directly in othercomprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reservein equity. Any ineffective element is recognised immediately in theGroup income statement. Gains and losses accumulated in thetranslation reserve are reclassified to the Group income statementwhen the foreign operation is disposed of.Offsetting financial instrumentsFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amountreported in the Group balance sheet when there is a current legallyenforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is anintention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle theliability simultaneously.ProvisionsProvisions are measured at the present value of the expendituresexpected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-taxdiscount rate that reflects current market assessments of the timevalue of money and the risks specific to the obligation.Supplier financing arrangementsSuppliers can choose whether to access supplier financingarrangements, which are provided by different third-party banks indifferent countries. Commercial requirements, including paymentterms or the price paid for goods, do not depend on whether asupplier chooses to access such arrangements. The arrangementssupport the Group’s suppliers by giving them the option to accesspayment earlier than the Group’s normal payment terms, oftenatalower cost than they could obtain themselves.The funding cost is set by the provider banks but based on Tesco’scredit risk and the appropriate country risk premium. Ifsupplierschoose not toaccess early payment, the provider banks pay thesuppliers on the Group’s normal payment terms. The Group pays theprovider banks on the Group’s normal payment terms, regardless ofwhether the supplier has chosen to access funding early.Management reviews supplier financing arrangements to determinethe appropriate presentation of balances outstanding astradepayables or borrowings, dependent on the nature of eacharrangement. Factors considered indetermining the appropriatepresentation include the commercial rationale for thearrangement,impact on the Group’s working capital positions, creditenhancements or other benefits provided to the bank andrecourseexposures.Balances outstanding under current supplier financing arrangementsare classified as trade payables, and cash flows are included inoperating cash flows, since thefinancing arrangements are agreedbetween the supplier and the banks, and the Group does notprovide additional credit enhancement nor obtain any workingcapital benefit from the arrangements. Refer to Note 19.InsuranceClassification of insurance contractsContracts under which the Group accepts significant insurance riskfromanother party (the policyholder) by agreeing to compensatethepolicyholder or other beneficiary if a specified uncertain futureevent (theinsured event) adversely affects the policyholder or otherbeneficiary are classified as insurance contracts. These contractsremain insurance contracts until all rights and obligations areextinguished or expire. Insurance contracts may also transfer somefinancial risk.Level of aggregationThe level of aggregation for the Group is determined firstly bydividing the business writteninto motor and home portfolios.Portfolios comprise groups of contracts with similar risks which aremanaged together. Atinitial recognition the Group assesses whetherthe motor and home portfolios are divided further into groups ofcontracts that are onerous, have no significant possibility ofbecoming onerous, or are neither.In determining the level of aggregation, the Group identifies acontract as the smallest ‘unit’,i.e. the lowest common denominator.No group for level of aggregation purposes shall contain contractsissued more than one year apart.The Group divides portfolios of reinsurance contracts held applyingthe same principles.Insurance contracts issuedInsurance contract liabilities include both a liability for incurredclaims (LIC), which represents outstanding claims and incurred butnot reported claims and other incurred insurance expenses; and aliability for remaining coverage (LRC), which represents the Group’sobligation for insured events related to the unexpired portion ofthe coverage period. The LRC is measured either using the generalmeasurement model (GMM) or asimplified premium allocationapproach (PAA).The Group applies the PAA to all insurance contracts issued sincethe acquisition of Tesco Underwriting (TU) in May 2021. The Groupqualifies to use this approach as the coverage period of eachcontract in the group is one year or less. There is no allowance forthe time value of money as the premiums are due within one yearofthe coverage period.Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024138.Financial statements\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf8d ---\n","The Group applies the GMM to all issued insurance contractsacquired on the acquisition of TU, asthe settlement of these claimsand their associated insurance risk will spread over multiple years.The Group has recognised an acquired claims liability as part of theLRC, which is measured at the probability-weighted average ofdiscounted cash flows plus a riskadjustment for non-financial risk,plus any contractual service margin(CSM) if the fulfilment cash flowsresult in a net inflow. If the fulfilment cash flows result in a netoutflow, an onerous loss is recognised in the Group incomestatement. The risk adjustment reflects the compensation that theGroup requires for bearing uncertainty in respect of the amount andtiming of the cash flows fromnon-financial risk, whilst the CSMrepresents the unearned profit in the contracts relating to servicesthat will be provided under the contracts in the future.Commission payable to agents and other acquisition costs, whichare incurred for acquiring new and renewal insurance business thatis primarily related to the production of that business, are deferredand presented as part of the LRC. Such deferred acquisition costsare amortised over the period of insurance contract services on thebasis ofthe passage of time.The carrying amount of the LRC measured under the GMM isupdated at the end of each reporting period to reflect currentestimates of the amounts, timing and uncertainty of future cashflows, as well as discount rates and other financial variables.The Group estimates the LIC asthe discounted value of expectedfulfilment cash flows related to incurred claims and other incurredinsurance expenses, plus an explicit adjustment for non-financialrisk. The fulfilment cash flows incorporate, in an unbiased way, allreasonable and supportable information available about the amount,timing and uncertainty of those future cash flows. Estimates of thepresent value of future cash flows reflect current expectations as atthe end of the reporting period andare adjusted for events whichhave occurred since actuarial valuation.Future cash flows are assessed by reviewing individual claims dataand making an allowance for claims incurred but not yet reported,adjusted for the effect on the claims incurred of both internal andexternal foreseeable events, such as changes in claims handlingprocedures, inflation, judicialtrends, substantively enactedlegislative changes and past experience and trends.ReinsuranceThe Group cedes reinsurance in the normal course of businessforthe purpose of limiting its net loss potential through thediversification of its risks.Reinsurance ceded includes quotashare,excess of loss and adverse development cover contracts.Reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the Group from its directobligations to its policyholders. Only contracts that give rise to asignificant transfer of insurance risk are accounted for asreinsurance contracts.Reinsurance assets include balances due from reinsurancecompanies for reinsurance claims. Amounts recoverable fromreinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with theoutstanding claims provision or settled claims associated withthereinsured policy.The Group applies the PAA to all reinsurance contracts that it holds,except for contracts held prior to the acquisition of TU. The PAAisapplicable for all reinsurance contracts purchased since theacquisition of TU as the contracts either qualify automatically inhaving a coverage period of one year or less, or because there isno material difference in their measurement between the PAAand the GMM.Modification and derecognition of insurance and reinsurancecontractsThe Group derecognises insurance and reinsurance contracts whenthe rights and obligations relatingto the contract are extinguished(i.e. discharged, cancelled or expired). When a modification is nottreated as aderecognition, the Group recognises amounts paid orreceived for the modification with the contract as an adjustment tothe relevant LRC or asset for remaining coverage.Presentation of insurance contracts issued, and reinsurancecontractsheldThe Group classifies all insurance contract liabilities as current asitdoes not have the right to defer settlement beyond 12 monthsafter the reporting date. The Group classifies its reinsuranceportfolio as non-current as it doesnot reasonably expect to realiseits reinsurance assets within 12 months of the reporting date.Insurance revenueThe insurance revenue recognised is the amount of expectedpremium receipts allocated to the period. For insurance contractsissued after the acquisition of TU in May 2021, the Group allocatesthe expected premium receipts to each period of insurancecontract services based on the passage of time.The insurance revenue recognised for insurance contracts acquiredas part of the acquisition of TU comprises:Claims costs incurred in the period measured at the amountsexpected at the beginning of the period;Changes in the risk adjustment for non-financial risk; andThe amount of the CSM recognised for services provided intheperiod.Insurance service expensesInsurance service expenses include total claims cost for the period,as well as all directly attributable insurance expenses. There are noacquisition costs for acquired claims. Insurance acquisition cashflows arising from the costs of selling, underwriting and starting agroup of insurance contracts are allocated to insurance serviceexpenses based on the passage of time.Net income or expenses from reinsurance contracts heldThe Group separately presents income or expenses from reinsurancecontracts held from the expenses or income from insurancecontracts issued. The Group presents the income or expensesfroma group of reinsurance contracts held as a single amount.Insurance finance income and expensesInsurance finance income and expenses comprise the change in thecarrying amount of the group of insurance contracts arising fromtheeffect of the time value of money, financial risk and changes infinancial risk.The impact of changes in market interest rates on the carrying valueof insurance assets and liabilities is reflected in the Group statementof other comprehensive income in order to minimise accountingmismatches between the accounting for financial assets andinsurance assets and liabilities. The Group’s financial assets backingboth the motor and home insurance portfolios are predominantlymeasured at fair value through other comprehensive income.The amount of insurance finance income and expenses recognised inthe Group income statement is calculated using the discount ratecurve determined at the dateof the incurred claim.Alternative performance measures (APMs)In the reporting of financial information, the Directors haveadoptedvarious APMs. Refer to the Glossary for a full list of theGroup’s APMs, including comprehensive definitions, their purpose,reconciliations to IFRS measures and details of any changes to APMs.Judgements and sources of estimation uncertaintyThe preparation of the consolidated Group financial statementsrequires management to make judgements, estimates andassumptions in applying the Group’s accounting policies todetermine the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income andexpenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based onhistorical experience and various other factors that are believed tobe reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differfrom these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions arereviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions to accounting estimatesapplied prospectively.Critical accounting judgementsCritical judgements, apart from those involving estimations, whichare applied in the preparation of the consolidated Group financialstatements are discussed below:Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024139.GovernanceAdditional informationFinancial statementsStrategic report\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pf8e ---\n","Notes to the Group financial statementscontinuedNote 1 Accounting policies, judgementsandestimatescontinuedLeasesManagement exercises judgement in determining the likelihood ofexercising break or extension options in determining the lease term.Break and extension options are included to provide operationalflexibility should the economic outlook for an asset be different toexpectations, and hence at commencement of the lease, break orextension options are not typically considered reasonably certain tobe exercised, unless there is a valid business reason otherwise.The discount rate used to calculate the lease liability is the rateimplicit inthe lease, if it can be readilydetermined, or the lessee’sincremental borrowing rate if not.Management uses the rate implicitin the lease where the lessor is a related party (such as leases fromjoint ventures) and the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate for allother leases. Incremental borrowing rates are determined monthlyand depend on the term, country, currency, and start date of thelease. The incremental borrowing rate is determined based on aseries of inputs including: the risk-free ratebased on governmentbond rates; a country-specificrisk adjustment; a credit riskadjustment based on Tesco bond yields; and an entity-specificadjustment where the entity risk profile is different to that oftheGroup.Refer to Note 12 for additionaldisclosures relating to leases.Joint ventures and associatesThe Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements underIFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’ and determined them to be jointventures. These assessments required the exercise of judgementasset out in Note 13.APMs – Adjusting itemsAdjusting items relate to certaincosts or incomes that derive fromevents or transactions that fall within the normal activities of theGroup but which, individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate,areexcluded from the Group’s APMs by virtue of their size andnature in order to provide a helpful alternative perspective of theyear-on-year trends, performance and position of the Group’strading business that is more comparable over time. This alternativeview is consistent with how management views thebusiness, andhow it is reported internally to the Board and ExecutiveCommitteefor performance analysis, planning, reporting, decision-making,and incentive-setting purposes.Management exercises judgement indetermining the adjustments toapply to IFRS measurements, and this assessment covers the natureof the item, cause of occurrence and the scale of impact of thatitem on reported performance and individual financial statementlineitems, as well as consistency with prior periods. Reversals ofprevious adjusting items are assessed based on the same criteria toensure an even-handed treatment of gains and losses. The amountand timing of adjusting items can be unpredictable and subject toahigher level of scrutiny by users of the accounts. Adjusting itemscan include, but are not limited to: litigation costs; impairmentcharges and reversals; property transactions such as disposals;amortisation of acquired intangibles; changes in uncertain taxpositions; restructuring and redundancy costs; profits or lossesondisposal ofbusinesses; net pension finance costs; and fair valueremeasurements of financial instruments. The tax effect of suchitems is also classified as adjusting.The Group income statement is presented in a columnar formattoenable users of the accounts to see the Group’s performancebefore adjusting items, the adjusting items, and the statutory totalon a line-by-line basis. An analysis ofthe adjusting items included inthe Group income statement, together with the impact of theseitems on the Group cash flow statement, is disclosed in Note 4.Refer to pages 220 to 225 for further details on the Group’s APMs.Key sources of estimation uncertaintyThe key assumptions about the future, and other key sources ofestimation uncertainty at the reporting period end, that may haveasignificant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carryingamount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year arediscussed below:Post-employment benefit obligationsThe present value of post-employment benefit obligations isdetermined on an actuarial basis using various assumptions,including the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality assumptions.Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amountaswell as the net pension cost/(income).

In determining the amount of volume-related allowances recognised in any period, management estimatesthe probability that the Group will meet contractual target volumes,based on historical and forecast performance. There is limitedestimation involved in recognising income for promotional andotherallowances.Management assesses its performance against the obligationsconditional on earning the income, with the income recognisedeither over time as the obligations are met, or recognised at thepoint when all obligations aremet, dependent on the contractualrequirements. Management views that the cost of inventories sold(which is inclusive of commercialincome) provides a consistent andcomplete measure of the Group income statement impact of theoverall supplier relationships.Management considers the bestindicator of the estimationundertaken is by reference to commercial income balances notsettled at the balance sheet date, and has therefore providedadditional disclosures of commercial income amounts reflectedinthe Group balance sheet.

Refer to Notes 1 and 33 for further details.Assessment of significant increases in credit riskAt each reporting date, the change in credit risk of the financial asset is observed using a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria, togetherwitha backstop based on arrears status. For each financial asset, Tesco Bank compares the lifetime PD at the reporting date with the lifetimePDthat was expected at the reporting date at initial recognition (PD threshold). Tesco Bank has established PD thresholds for each type ofproduct whichvary depending on initial term and term remaining. A number ofqualitative criteria are in place such as: forbearance offeredto customers in financial difficulty; risk-based pricing post-origination; credit indebtedness; credit limit decrease; and pre-delinquencyinformation. As a backstop, Tesco Bank considers that if anaccount’s contractual payments are more than 30 days past due thenasignificant increase in credit risk has taken place.The ECLs calculation and the measurement of significant deterioration in credit risk both incorporate forward-looking information using arange of macroeconomic scenarios, with key variables being the Bank of England base rate, unemployment rate and gross domesticproduct.There are four scenarios commissioned from a third-party provider:ScenarioScenarioassumptionsWeighting (%)BaseNo further increase in base rate, inflation trends downwards toward 2% target by mid-2024.

The Group led the formation of the entities and its nameappears in thename of the entities and/or on the debt issued by the entities. The structured entities were set up to finance property purchases by some ofthe UK property joint ventures in which the Group typically holds a 50% equity interest. The structured entities obtain debt financing fromthird-party investors and lend the funds to these jointventures, who use the funds to purchase the properties.The liabilities of the UK property joint ventures include the loans due to these structured entities. The Group’s exposure to the structuredentities is limited to the extent of the Group’s interests in the joint ventures. The liabilities of the structured entities are non-recourse tothe Group.The Group concluded that it does not control, and therefore should not consolidate, these structured entities since it does nothave powerover the relevant activities of the structured entities,or exposure to variable returns from these entities.Consolidated structured entitiesThe Group has a number of securitisation structured entities established in connection with Tesco Bank’s credit card securitisationtransactions as wellas financing structured entities controlled as a result ofthe acquisition of UK property joint ventures. Although noneof the equity of these entities is owned by the Group, the Grouphas rights to variable returnsfrom its involvement with theseentities andhas the ability to affect those returns throughits power over them under contractual agreements. Assuch, these entities are effectivelycontrolled by the Group, and are therefore accounted for as subsidiaries of the Group. The securitisation structured entities are includedin the Banking operations disposal group.The securitisation structured entities have financial year endsof 31 December. The management accounts of these entities are used toconsolidate the results to 24 February 2024 within these financialstatements.

These property investments generally covershopping centres and standalone stores. The Group enters into leases for some or all of the properties held in the joint ventures. Theseleases provide the Group with some rights over alterations andadjacent land developments. In some cases, the Group has the ability tosubstitute properties in thejoint ventures with alternative properties of similar value,subject to strict eligibility criteria. In other cases theGroup carries out property management activities forthird-party rentals of shopping centre units.Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024158.Financial statements\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pfa1 ---\n","The property investment activities are carried out in separate entities, usually partnerships or limited liability companies. The Group hasassessed its ability to direct the relevant activities of theseentities and any impact on Group returns and concluded that theentities qualifyas joint ventures since decisions regarding them require the unanimous consent of both equity holders. This assessment includednot onlyrights within the joint venture agreements, but also any rightswithin other contractual arrangements between the Group and theentities.The Group made a number of judgements in arrivingat this determination, the key ones being:since the provisions of the joint ventureagreements require the relevant decisions impacting investor returns to be either unanimouslyagreed by both joint venturers at the same time, or in some casesto be agreed sequentially by each venturer at different stages, there isjoint decision making within the joint venture;since the Group’s leases are priced at fair value, and any rightsembedded in the leases are consistent with market practice, they do notprovide the Group with additional control overthe joint ventures nor do they infer anobligation by the Group to fund the settlement ofliabilities of the joint ventures;any options to purchase the other joint venturers’ equity stakesare priced at market value, and only exercisable at future dates, hencethey donot provide control to the Group at the current time;where the Group has a right to substitute properties in the joint ventures, the rights are strictly limited and are at fair value, hence do notprovide control to the Group; andwhere the Group carries out property management activities for third-party rentals in shopping centres, these additional activities arecontrolled through joint venture agreements or lease agreements,and do not provide the Group with additional powers over the joint venture.Tesco Coral acquisitionIn January 2024, the Group obtained control of The Tesco Coral Limited Partnership, which held four stores and was previously accountedfor as a joint venture, following the withdrawal of the jointventure partner. The joint venture partner took ownership of twostores, which itcontinues to lease to the Group.The transaction was treated as an asset acquisition. The non-cash consideration, principally comprising the elimination of theloan to thejoint venture and derecognition of pre-existing right of useassets and lease liabilities, was £54m. On acquisition, the Grouprecognisedproperty, plant and equipment of £65m, cash of£7m, and £1m relating to other immaterial balances. The Group also realised £19mdeferredprofit, arising from the original sale to the JV, on the two properties retained by the joint venture partner. This profit wastreated as anadjusting item included as part of property transactions.

Estimates are based on past experience and expectations offuture changes in the market, including the prevailing economic climate and global economy, competitor activity, market dynamics, changingcustomer behaviours, structural challenges facing retail andthe resilience afforded by the Group’s operational scale.Cash flow projections are based on the Group’s three-year internalforecasts, the results of which are reviewed by the Board. Theforecastsinclude best estimate assumptions on inflation, which differby both country and revenue and cost categories. The forecasts areextrapolated to five years based on management’s expectations, andbeyond five years based on estimated long-term average growth rates.Long-term growth rates for the Retail business are based on inflation forecasts by recognised bodies. Cash flow forecasts are allocated tostore-level cash-generating units based on their relative currentyear actual sales performance, after adjusting for one-off cash flowsaffecting particular stores.The Group applies an expected cash flow approach by probability-weighting different cash flow scenarios. The greatest probability weightingisapplied to the cash flows derived from the three-year internal forecasts. One downside scenario takes account of the riskspresented byongoing geopolitical and globalsupply issues triggering further inflation, leadingto weak consumer confidence and intensified competition.Asecond downside scenario takes account of climate change impacts. These are consistent with the viability statement scenarios (see theLonger term viability statement in the Strategic report). The viability statement scenarios reflect ‘severe but plausible’ risks, to whichmanagement applies probability weightings in order to reflect management’s best estimate of future economic conditions. There is also anupside scenario which assumes a moderate outperformance of the three-year internal forecasts.In addition to the climate change scenario included within the probability-weighted cash flows, the Group incorporates other climate changerelated assumptions into the impairmentmodelling, including, but not limited to, investments in technology to aid the Group’snet zerocommitments, the costs associated with replacing end-of-life assets with more environmentally-friendly alternatives, and assumptions overthe cash flow profile of the Group’s fuel business.Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the market assessment as at the balance sheet date of thetime valueof money and the risks specific to the cash-generating units. The pre-tax discount rates are derived from the Group’s post-taxweightedaverage cost of capital, as adjusted for the specific risks relating to each geographical region and on a nominal basis. The Group engagesindependent valuation specialists to determine appropriate discount rates. Risk-free rates are based on government bond rates,adjustedfor eachgeographical region and equity risk premiaand equity beta are based ondata from recognised bodies. The capital asset pricingmodel is used to calculate the cost of equity.Money services and insuranceValue in use is calculated by discounting free cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on the three-year internal forecasts, approved bythe Board. The forecasts are extrapolated to five years based onmanagement’s expectations and beyond five years based on estimatedlong-term average growth rates. The long-term growth rates are based on inflation and GDP growth forecasts by recognised bodies. Thediscount rate is the cost of equity. The capital asset pricingmodel is used to calculate the cost of equity. The Group engagesindependentvaluation specialists to determine appropriate risk-free rates and equity risk premia. The equity beta are derived from recognised bodies.Fair value less costs of disposalFair values of owned properties are determined with regard to themarket rent for the stores or for alternative uses with investmentyieldsappropriate to reflect the physical characteristics of the property, location, performance, infrastructure, energy efficiency rating,redevelopment potential and other factors. Insome cases, fair values include residualvaluations where stores may be viable forredevelopment. Fair values of leased propertiesare determined with regard to the discounted market rent for the property overtheremaining period of the lease, reflecting the condition and location of the property and the local rental market, adjusted fora suitable voidperiod. Fair values of the Group’s properties were determined with the assistanceof independent professional valuers where appropriate.Costs of disposal are estimated based on past experience in each geographical region.Investments in joint ventures and associatesThe recoverable values of investments in joint ventures and associates are estimated taking into account forecast cash flows, equityvaluations of comparable entities and/or recenttransactions for comparable businesses.Key assumptions and sensitivityKey assumptionsFor value in use calculations, the key assumptions to which the recoverable amounts are most sensitive are discount rates, long-term growthrates and future cash flows (incorporating sales volumes, pricesand costs).

The provision is based onbest estimates for individual properties, withreference to previous experience and size ofleased property, or specific agreementswith the landlord where relevant. The term is measured in accordance with the outstanding lengthofleases or the expected timing of specific obligations.Onerous contract provisions are recognised where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed theeconomic benefits expected to be received under it. The timing of provisions is determined by reference to the contract givingrise tothe obligations.Decommissioning provisions reflect the Group’s long-term obligation for site-level environmental remediation works, arising fromgovernment regulations and changing consumer habits. The extent and cost of future environmental remediation represents a bestestimateapplied across the property portfolio based on past experience, the extent of remediation work required and the expected timingof activity,for which there is a high level of uncertainty.Amounts provided in the year primarily relate to charges for dilapidation and similar remediation provisions.

Due to the nature of legal and regulatory matters, including unpredictable timings oflegal cases or regulatory investigations, there is often uncertainty as to if or when provisions will be fully utilised.Amounts provided in the year include a provision for customer redress in relation to invalid notices of sums in arrears in Tesco Bank.Operational insurance provisionsInsurance provisions relate to outstanding liabilities from publicand employer's liability and third-party motor claims acrossthe Group’strading operations, separate to the Tesco Underwriting insurance balances in Note 24.

Each notified claim is assessed on a separate, casebycase basis with due regard to the claim circumstances and historicalevidence of the size of similar claims and provisions are based oninformation currently available. However, the ultimate liabilities may vary asa result of subsequent developments.Sources of dataThe sources of data used as inputs for the assumptions are internal, using detailed studies that are carried out at least annually to ensurethat the assumptions are consistent with observable market prices or other publishedinformation. When there is insufficient information tomake a reliable best estimate of claims development, suitable benchmark assumptions are used.MethodsThe cost of outstanding claims and the incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims provisions are estimated using various statistical methods,which extrapolate the development of paid and incurred claims, average cost per claim and ultimate claim numbers for each accident periodbased upon observed development of earlier periods, with reference to suitable benchmarks. The key methods are:development factor methods, which use historical data to estimatethe paid and incurred to date as proportions of the ultimateclaim cost;individual claim assessment methods, which use claimspecific details for large individual claimsto estimate the ultimate claim cost; andbenchmarking methods, which use the experience ofcomparable, more mature classes, or market data to estimate the cost of claims.To the extent that these methods use historical claims development information, they also assume that the historical claims developmentpattern will occur again in the future, after allowing (wherepossible) for instances where this might not be the case, such aschangingeconomic or legal trends.RecoveriesThe provisions are initially estimated at a gross level and a separate calculation is carried out to estimate the size of reinsurance recoveries.The Group is covered by a variety of excess of loss reinsurance programmes. The methods used by the Group take into account historicaldata, specific details for individual large claims and detailsof the reinsurance programme to assess the expected size of reinsurancerecoveries. Recoveries through salvage and subrogation are estimated and recorded as part of the liability for incurred claimsbased on acombination of suitable benchmark assumptions and the observed development to date.Risk adjustment for non-financial riskThe risk adjustment for non-financial risk is the compensationthat the Group requires for bearing uncertainty around the amount and timingof the cash flows of groups of insurance contracts. The Group has used a confidence level (probability of sufficiency) approachat the77.5th percentile.Discount rateInsurance contract liabilities are calculated by discounting expected future cash flows using a yield curve based on a replicating portfolio andutilising a top-down approach. The replicating portfolio is adjusted for credit risk and allows for the duration of the Group'sliabilities. TheGBP curve used is aligned with the currency of the Group's liabilities.The yield curves applied for discounting future cash flows of liabilities for incurred claims are listed below:One yearThree yearsFive years10 yearsMean 11-100 years%%%%%As at 24 February 20244.9%4.7%4.6%4.4%4.3%As at 25 February 20234.4%4.6%4.5%4.2%4.1%Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024172.Financial statements\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pfaf ---\n","Actual claims payments are compared withprevious estimates of the undiscounted amountsof the claims in the tables below on agross andnet of reinsurance basis.Claims development (gross)202220232024TotalEstimate of gross undiscounted ultimate claims costs£m£m£m£mAt end of financial year212280370One year later201287–Two years later182––Current estimate of cumulative claims182287370839Cumulative payments to date(147)(213)(197)(557)Gross undiscounted liabilities for incurred claims3574173282Value of risk adjustment11Effect of discounting(34)Gross claims liabilities259Ancillary claims and expense liabilities7Total gross liabilities for incurred claims266Claims development (net)202220232024TotalEstimate of net undiscounted ultimate claims costs£m£m£m£mAt end of financial year141180221One year later126163–Two years later115––Current estimate of cumulative claims115163221499Cumulative net payments to date assuming recoveries received(92)(132)(109)(333)Net undiscounted liabilities for incurred claims2331112166Value of risk adjustment9Effect of discounting(13)Net claims liabilities162Quota share funds withheld (receivable recoveries)(203)Ancillary claims and expense liabilities4Total net assets for incurred claims(37)The Group provides information on the grossand net claims development from the date ofacquisition of TU in May 2021 to the currentreporting period, as it was not party toclaims made prior tothe acquisition date.Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024173.GovernanceAdditional informationFinancial statementsStrategic report\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pfb0 ---\n","Notes to the Group financial statementscontinuedNote 25 Customer deposits and deposits from banks20242023£m£mCustomer deposits*–5,770Deposits from banks908980Of which:9086,750Current1084,485Non-current8002,2659086,750*Customer deposits were classified as held for sale in the year, as part of the Bankingoperations disposal group.

The financial risk management in relation to Retail is carried out by a central treasurydepartment.

However, it does include the foreign exchange sensitivity resulting from localentity non-functional currency financial instruments.The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debtandderivatives portfolio, and the proportion of financial instrumentsin foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis ofthe hedgedesignations in place at 24 February 2024. It should be noted that the sensitivity analysis reflects the impact on income and equity due tofinancial instruments held at the balance sheet date. It does not reflect any change in sales or costs that may result from changing interestorexchange rates.The following assumptions were made incalculating the sensitivity analysis:the sensitivity of interest payable to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposits andderivative instruments with no sensitivity assumed for RPI-linked borrowings, which have been swapped to fixed rates;changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instrumentsdesignated as fair value hedges against movements in interestrates orforeign exchange rates have an immaterial effect on the Group income statement and equity due to compensating adjustments in thecarrying value ofdebt;changes in the carrying value of financial instruments designatedas net investment hedges against movements in foreign exchange ratesare recorded directly in the Group statement of comprehensive income/(loss);all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments are fully effective with noimpact on the Group income statement; andthe floating leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treatedas not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in interestrates affects a full 12-month period for the interest payable portion of the sensitivity calculations.Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the quantitative effect on the Group income statement and the Group statement ofchanges in equity that would result, at the balance sheet date, from changes in interest rates, inflation rates, currency exchange rates andcommodity prices thatare reasonably possible for major currencies wherethere have recently been significant movements:2024IncomeEquitygain/(loss)gain/(loss)£m£m1% increase in interest rates325% appreciation of the Euro(5)(49)5% appreciation of the US Dollar23850 basis points parallel upward shift in the forward inflation curve932310% increase in commodity prices*110*Relating to diesel prices only, where derivatives are used to hedge risk.A decrease in interest rates and commodity prices, depreciation offoreign currencies and downward shift in the forward inflation curvewould have the opposite effect to the impact in the table above.The impact on the Group income statement resulting from changes in foreign exchangerates against GBP in relation to financialinstruments(excluding those arising on consolidation) is minimal as Group policy dictates that all material income statement foreign exchange exposuresarehedged.In prior years, the Group entered into a number of derivative index-linked contracts with external counterparties, to economically hedge aproportion of the Group’s exposure to index-linked lease liabilities with its joint ventures. These are specifically not designated as accountinghedges but are economic hedges. However, the gains and losses on the hedging instrument and hedged item do notnaturally offset in theGroup income statement. This mismatch arises due to different accounting outcomes of IFRS 9 and IFRS 16, which results in a timing difference.The impact on the Group statement of comprehensive income/(loss) fromchanging exchange rates results from the revaluation of financialliabilities used as net investment hedges. The impact on the Group statement of comprehensive income/(loss) will largely be offset by therevaluation in equity of the hedged assets inthe Group statement of changes in equity.Derivatives and hedging exposuresDerivatives are used to hedge exposure to market risks, some of which are economic hedges and others are formally designatedhedginginstruments with hedge accounting applied. The main sources of hedge ineffectiveness are the effects of the counterparties' andtheGroup's own credit risk on thefair value of derivatives.The fair value and notional amounts of derivatives analysed by hedge type are shown on page 181.Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024180.Financial statements\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pfb7 ---\n","Asset2024LiabilityAsset2023LiabilityFair valueNotionalFair valueNotionalFair valueNotionalFair valueNotional£m£m£m£m£m£m£m£mFair value hedgesInterest rate swaps44916(103)1,1521222,692(147)2,552Cross-currency swaps––(126)640––(137)662Banking operations disposal group503,355(16)1,543––––Cash flow hedgesInterest rate swaps––(2)50––(3)50Index-linked swaps265790––240738––Foreign currency forward contracts20818(17)862301,091(58)1,352Diesel forward contracts231(2)57414(13)119Derivatives not in a formal hedgerelationshipInterest rate swaps––––138(9)696Cross-currency swaps182790(13)94211822(4)100Index-linked swaps3182,074––3112,074––Foreign currency forward contracts5379(3)43311821(14)539Diesel forward contracts–1–4–2(2)13Banking operations disposal group4315(1)–––––Total8909,469(283)4,8359308,292(387)6,083(a)(b)(a)(a)Interest rate swaps within the Banking operations disposal group.(b)The notional values included in the table have been adjusted to reflect the impact of inflation indexation on the principal.The notional values before indexation for derivativesdesignated in a cash flow hedge was £406m (2023: £406m).The following table sets out the maturity profile and average interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates of the hedging instrumentsused in the Group’s hedging strategies.20242023Up toOne toMore thanUp toOne toMore thanMaturity profileone yearfive yearsfive yearsone yearfive yearsfive yearsNotional amount (£m)Fair value hedgesInterest rate swaps – GBP1507267661,3662,663553Interest rate swaps – EUR––426662––Cross currency swaps (GBP: EUR)––640––662Banking operations disposal group2,6952,15746–––Cash flow hedgesIndex-linked swaps–411379–392346Interest rate swaps–50–––50Average net interest rate (pay)/receiveFair value hedgesInterest rate swaps – GBP4.39%(3.58)%(3.67)%(1.78)%(1.43)%(3.40)%Interest rate swaps – EUR––(0.88)%(1.81)%––Cross currency swaps (GBP: EUR)––(5.91)%––(4.65)%Banking operations disposal group(0.50)%(1.18)%(1.05)%–––Cash flow hedgesIndex-linked swaps–(4.23)%(4.21)%–(4.23)%(4.21)%Interest rate swaps–0.29%–––(4.46)%(a)(b)(a)(b)(a)Average exchange rate for cross-currency swaps (GBP:EUR) is 1.128 (2023: 1.128).(b) Interest rate swaps within the Banking operations disposal group.At 24 February 2024, foreign currency forward contracts, designatedas cash flow hedges, equivalent to £1.7bn were outstanding(2023:£2.4bn).

The Group has no furtherpayment obligations once its contributions have been paid. Contributions paid for defined contribution schemes in continuing operationsof £415m (2023: £375m) have been recognised inthe Group income statement. This includes£166m (2023: £143m) of salaries paid aspension contributions.Defined benefit schemesThe Group has a defined benefit pension deficit of £657m (2023: £400m), and a defined benefit pension surplus of £22m (2023: £6m),comprising a number of schemes. The most significant schemes are for the Group’s employees in the UK and ROI, which are closedto futureaccrual. The defined benefit pension deficit in the UK represents 104% (2023: 102%) of the net Group deficit.United KingdomThe principal scheme within the Group is the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme (the Scheme), the assets of which are held as a segregated fund andadministered by the Trustee.The Scheme is established under trust law and has a corporate trustee (the Trustee) that is required to run the Scheme in accordance withthe Scheme’s Trust Deed and Rules and to comply with all relevant legislation. Responsibilityfor the governance of the Schemelies with theTrustee. TheTrustee is a company whose directors comprise:1.representatives of the Group;2.independent trustees; and3.representatives of the Scheme participants, in accordancewith its articles of association and UK pension law.In June 2023, the UK High Court (Virgin Media Limited v NTL Pension Trustees II Limited) ruled thatcertain historical amendments forcontracted-out defined benefit schemes were invalid if they werenot accompanied by the correct actuarial confirmation notice,thejudgement of which is being appealed. The Trustee and Group aremonitoring the development of this case and will consider if there are anyimplications for the schemes, if the ruling is upheld.Scheme fundingThe Group considers two measures of thepension surplus/deficit. The accounting position is shown on the Group balance sheet. The fundingposition, calculated at the triennial funding valuation, is used to agree contributions made to the schemes. The two measures will varybecause theyare for different purposes and are calculated at different dates and in different ways. The key calculation difference is thatthefunding position considers the expected returns of scheme assets when calculating the liability, whereas the accounting position calculatedunder IAS19 discounts liabilities based on corporate bond yields.The most recent completed triennial fundingvaluation of the Scheme was performed as at31 March 2022 using the projected unitcreditmethod. Thefunding position wasa surplus of £0.9bn. The Scheme remained ina funding surplus as at 24 February 2024.Subsequent to this triennial funding valuation it was agreed thatno further pension deficit contributions would be required, withcontributions next expected to be assessed at the 31 March 2025triennial review. The Group was paying £25m per annum to meet expensesof the Scheme, including the Pension Protection Fund levy. This expense payment fell to £17m per annum from October 2022. Inaddition, themarket value of assets held as security in favourof the Scheme is at least £775m (2023: £775m).The most recent Booker Pension Scheme triennialfunding valuation showed a funding deficitof £139m at 31 March 2022, with agreedcontributions of£17m per annum until the end of 2028. The most recent Budgens Pension Scheme triennial funding valuation showed afunding surplus of £0.4m at31March 2021. No contributions were required for the Budgens Scheme.IFRIC 14For schemes in an accounting surplus position, these surpluses are recognised on the balance sheet in line with IFRIC 14, asthe Group has anunconditional legal right to any future economic benefits by way of future refunds following a gradual settlement.Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024192.Financial statements\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pfc3 ---\n","£bnStrategic reportGovernanceAdditional informationFinancial statements193.Maturity profile of the defined benefit obligationThe estimated duration of the Scheme defined benefit obligation is anindicator of the weighted average term of benefit payments afterdiscounting.

Toaccount forthe premium that investors are willing to pay to mitigate the risk that inflation is higher than expected, the inflation assumption incorporatesan inflation riskpremium. CPI inflation is set by reference to RPI.The Group uses a bifurcated approach to pre- and post-2030 assumptions, reflecting the impact of the RPI reforms from 2030 onwards.Inconsultation with external actuaries, the inflation risk premiumhas been set at 0.3% p.a. pre-2030 and 0.5% p.a. post-2030, which is aweighted average of 0.44% (2023: 0.43%). TheCPI differential has been set as 1.0% p.a.pre-2030 and 0.1% p.a. post-2030, whichis aweighted average of 0.46%lower than RPI (2023: 0.48%).Mortality assumptionsThe Trustee’s actuary conducted a mortality analysis of the Schemeas part of the triennial fundingvaluation process. Subsequent to thisanalysis, theGroup adopted the best estimate assumptions for the calculationof the defined benefit obligation for the main UK scheme.The mortality assumptions used are based on tables that have beenprojected to 2018 with CMI 2020improvements. In addition, theallowance for future mortality improvements from 2018 has been updated to be in line with CMI 2022, with a long-term improvement rateof1.00% p.a., a 0% weighting applied to both2020 and 2021 data and a 50% weighting applied to 2022, reflecting the expectation that theCOVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on future life expectancies.The base tables used in calculating the mortality assumptions are different for various categories of members, as shown below:PensionerNon-PensionerMaleStaff96% of SAPS S3 Normal Heavy100% of SAPS S3 Normal HeavySenior Manager112% of SAPS S3 Normal Light113% of SAPS S3 Normal LightFemaleStaff105% of SAPS S3 NormalHeavy109% of SAPS S3 Normal HeavySenior Manager87% of SAPS S3 All Middle87% of SAPS S3 All MiddleThe following table illustrates the life expectancy of an average member retiring at age 65 at the balance sheet date and a member reachingage65 at the balance sheet date +25 years.

IFRS 17 primarily impacts Tesco Bank andthere is no material impact on the Retail segment.IFRS 17 is effective for the accounting period commencing 26 February 2023. IFRS 17 has been applied fully retrospectively andcomparativesfor prior periods have been restated from a transition date of 27February 2022. Refer to Note 1 for the Group's insurance accounting policies.The Group applies the premium allocation approach to measure itsportfolio of insurance contracts issued and reinsurance contractspurchased, except for claims liabilities acquired as part of the acquisition of Tesco Underwriting Limited on 4 May 2021. Unlike post-acquisitioncontracts issued with a term of one year, the Group has applied the general measurement model (GMM) to the acquired claims liabilitiesbecause the settlement of these claims and their associated insurance risk will spread over multiple years. This measurement leads to therecognition of revenue and expenses in relation to these acquiredclaims over a longer period of time. It includes a contractual service margin(CSM), which represents the difference between the consideration paid for the acquired claims at acquisition and the risk-adjusted discountedfulfilment cash flows and will be allocated to the Group income statementover time to reflect the pattern of actual claims settlement.To aid comparability, the tables below alsoinclude the impact of the restatements resulting from the classification of the Group’s Bankingoperations as a discontinued operation, as described in Note 7.Group income statement restatementThe table below sets out the impact of IFRS 17 and restatements to present Banking operations as a discontinued operation on thecomparative period Group income statementfor the 52 weeks ended 25 February 2023.ReportedDiscontinuedRestatedTotalIFRS 17 restatementsoperationTotalReclassificationRemeasurementsRe-presentation£m£m£m£m£mContinuing operationsRevenue from sale of goods and services65,453(21)–(568)64,864Insurance revenue30921128–458Revenue65,762–128(568)65,322Cost of sales(61,877)51355(61,516)Insurance service expenses(175)(84)(408)(149)–Net expenses from reinsurance contracts held(49)–12–(37)Gross profit/(loss)3,661(79)(8)(213)3,361Administrative expenses(2,136)79–106(1,951)Operating profit/(loss)1,525–(8)(107)1,410Share of post-tax profits of joint ventures andassociates8–––8Financeincome85–2–87Finance costs(618)–(5)–(623)Profit/(loss) before tax1,000–(11)(107)882Taxation(247)–320(224)Profit/(loss) for the year from continuing operations753–(8)(87)658Discontinued operationsProfit/(loss) for the year fromdiscontinued operations(9)––8778Profit/(loss) for the year744–(8)–736Attributable to:Owners of the parent745–(8)–737Non-controlling interests(1)–––(1)744–(8)–736Earnings per share from continuing and discontinuedoperationsBasic10.05p–(0.11)p–9.94pDiluted9.96p–(0.11)p–9.85pEarnings per share from continuing operationsBasic10.17p–(0.11)p(1.17)p8.89pDiluted10.08p–(0.11)p(1.16)p8.81p(a)(b)––––––(a)The income statement has been re-presented to separately present insurance revenue, insurance service expenses, and net expenses from reinsurance contracts held.(b) In addition to the adoption of IFRS 17, comparatives have also been re-presented to present Banking operations as a discontinued operation.

In addition,Tesco PLC will guarantee any contingent and prospective liabilities thatthesesubsidiaries are subject to.Tesco BankAt 24 February 2024, Tesco Bank had contractual lending commitments totalling £12.8bn(2023: £12.2bn). The contractual amountsrepresenttheamounts that would be at risk should the available facilities be fully drawn upon and not the amounts at risk at the reportingdate.Contingent liabilitiesAs previously reported, Tesco Stores Limited (TSL) (along with all the major supermarkets) has received claims from current andformerhourly-paid store colleagues alleging that they do equal work to that of colleagues working in its distribution centres and that differences interms and conditions relating to pay are not objectively justifiable (the Equal Pay Claims). Theclaimants are seeking the differential betweenthe pay terms looking back, and equivalence of pay terms moving forward. As at the date of this disclosure, there are approximately 49,000claims against TSL, with the number of claims expectedto continue to increase as the litigation progresses.UK equal pay law provides that an employee is entitled to the sameterms in relation to pay as those of a comparator of the opposite sex inthe same employment if they are employed to do equal work. The legislation achieves this by implying a clause into the contractofemployment, which has the effect of importing into the employee’s contract the more favourable term(s) of the comparator.Equal pay claims are typically heard in three stages and the claimants have to win at every stage in order to succeed. The first stage iscomparability, which is effectively a technical gateway to the claims proceeding. The claimants have to show that there is a valid basis in lawfor comparing their pay and the pay of any comparator. One of thelegal bases here is that pay terms are set by the same body.Following aEuropean court ruling on this, TSL has made a concession on comparability.The subsequent stages comprise an equal work assessment and the consideration of TSL’s material factor defences (non-discriminatoryreasons for differentials in pay terms). The Equal Pay Claimshave been split into three tranches (with tranche 1 being heard first) and thestages apply to each tranche. Although the claims that have been heardto date involve female claimants, male store workers (being close to50% of the current store worker population) may also bring claims by comparing themselves against any successful female claimants.  Maleclaimants who have pre-emptively brought such claims currently make up approximately 45% of the Equal Pay Claims against TSL intheemployment tribunal. The ultimate determination of all claims islikely to take many years, including as a result of appeals.At present, the total number of Equal Pay Claims that may be received, the merits, and likely outcome of those claims and of TSL's defencesto them, and the potential impact on the Group, are subject tovarious and substantial uncertainties. There are multiple factual and legaldefences to these claims and the Group intendsto defend them vigorously, while at the same time taking appropriate steps to mitigate therisks. The Group therefore cannot make an assessment of the likelyoutcome of the litigation, or the potential quantum of its liability or thepotential impact on the Group at this stage. Depending on the outcome at the various stages of the Equal Pay Claims, and dependent on thenumber of any ultimately successful claims, thepotential quantum of its liability could be material.There are a number of other contingent liabilities that arise in the normal course of business, which if realised, are not expected to result inamaterial liability to the Group.Note 35 Events after the reporting periodThere were no material events after thereporting period requiring disclosure.Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024203.GovernanceAdditional informationFinancial statementsStrategic report\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pfce ---\n","Tesco PLC – Parent Company balance sheetNotes24 February2024£m25 February2023£mNon–current assetsInvestments616,990 16,970Receivables7234 234Derivative financial instruments8949 93518,173 18,139Current assetsReceivables7537 860Cash on hand231 103Derivative financial instruments8– 2768 965Current liabilitiesPayables9(756) (244)Borrowings10(55) (141)(811) (385)Net current assets/(liabilities)(43) 580Non–current liabilitiesPayables9(1,131) (2,132)Borrowings10(1,473) (1,450)Derivative financial instruments8(13) (5)Deferred tax liabilities11(23) (19)(2,640) (3,606)Net assets15,490 15,113EquityShare capital14445 463Share premium5,165 5,165Other reserves142,865 2,793Retained earnings (including profit/(loss) for the financialyear of £1,866m (2023: £2,064m))7,015 6,692Total equity15,490 15,113The notes on pages 206 to 211 form part of these financial statements.Ken MurphyImran NawazDirectorsThe Parent Company financial statements on pages 204 to 211 wereapproved and authorised for issue by the Directors on 9 April2024.Tesco PLCRegistered number 00445790Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024204.Financial statements\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pfcf ---\n","Tesco PLC – Parent Company statement of changes in equityShare capital(Note 14)£mShare premium£mOther reserves(Note 14)£mRetained earnings£mTotal equity£mAt 25 February 20234635,1652,7936,69215,113Profit/(loss) for the year–––1,8661,866Other comprehensive income/(loss)Gains/(losses) on cash flow hedges––25–25Cash flow hedges reclassified and reported in the Companyincome statement––(55)–(55)Tax relating to components of other comprehensive income(Note 11)––(4)–(4)Total other comprehensive income/(loss)––(34)–(34)Total comprehensive income/(loss)––(34)1,8661,832Transfer from hedging reserve to retained earnings––44(44)–Transactions with ownersOwn shares purchased for cancellation––(752)–(752)Own shares cancelled(18)–770(752)–Own shares purchased for share schemes––(140)–(140)Share-based payments––18430214Dividends–––(777)(777)Total transactions with owners(18)-62(1,499)(1,455)At 24 February 20244455,1652,8657,01515,490Share capital(Note 14)£mShare premium£mOther reserves(Note 14)£mRetained earnings£mTotal equity£mAt 26 February 20224845,1652,8046,24214,695Profit/(loss) for the year–––2,0642,064Other comprehensive income/(loss)Gains/(losses) on cash flow hedges––7–7Cash flow hedges reclassified and reported in the Companyincome statement–– (58)– (58)Tax relating to components of other comprehensive income––13–13Total other comprehensive income/(loss)––((38)–((38)Total comprehensive income/(loss)––((38)2,064 2,026Transactions with ownersOwn shares purchased for cancellation––(758)–(758)Own shares cancelled(21)–816(795)–Own shares purchased for share schemes––(188)–(188)Share-based payments––15739196Dividends –––(858)(858)Total transactions with owners(21)–27(1,614)(1,608)At 25 February 20234635,1652,7936,69215,113The Company has considered the profits available for distribution to shareholders.

The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entityunder FRS 100, ‘Application of Financial Reporting Requirements’asissued by the Financial Reporting Council.The Company’s financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling,its functional currency, generally rounded to the nearestmillion.The principal accounting policies adopted by the Company aresetout in Note 2. The financial statements have been preparedunder the historical cost convention, except for certain financialinstruments and share-based payments that have beenmeasuredatfair value.Note 2 Accounting policiesBasis of preparation of financial statementsThe Parent Company financial statements have been prepared inaccordance with FRS 101 and the Companies Act 2006 (the Act).FRS 101 sets out a reduced disclosure framework for a ‘qualifyingentity’ as defined in the standard, which addresses the financialreporting requirements and disclosure exemptions in theindividualfinancial statements of qualifying entities that otherwiseapply the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirementsofadoptedIFRS.The financial year represents the 52 weeks to 24 February 2024(priorfinancial year 52 weeks to 25 February 2023).As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of thedisclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation tobusiness combinations, financial instruments, capital management,presentation of comparative information in respect of certainassets, presentation of a cash flow statement, impairment ofassets,share-based payments, related party transactions anddisclosure of the possible impact of the application of a new IFRSthat has been issued but is not yet effective. Where required,equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidatedfinancialstatements of Tesco PLC.The Parent Company financial statements are prepared on a goingconcern basis as set out in Note 1 of the consolidated financialstatements of Tesco PLC.The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption availableunder section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and not presentedanincome statement or a statement of comprehensiveincome/(loss) fortheCompany alone.A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is setoutbelow.Investments in subsidiaries and joint venturesInvestments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are stated at cost less,where appropriate, provisions for impairment. The Company teststheinvestment balances for impairment annually or when there areindicators of impairment.Foreign currenciesTransactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functionalcurrency at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction.Ateach balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that aredenominated in foreign currencies are retranslated to the functionalcurrency at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.Share-based paymentsThe fair value of employee share option plans is calculated atthegrant date using the Black-Scholes model. Theresulting cost ischarged to the Company income statement overthevesting period.The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected andactual levels of vesting. Where the Company awards shares oroptions to employees of subsidiary entities, this is treated as acapital contribution.Own shares heldOwn shares represent the shares of Tesco PLC that are held by theTesco International Employee Benefit Trust, or which are purchasedand held for cancellation as part of the share buyback programme.The Company adopts a‘look-through’ approach which, in substance,accounts for the trust as an extension of the Company. Sharespurchased for cancellation are included in own shares held untilcancellation, at which point they are transferred to retained earnings.Own shares held can include equity elements of forward contractswhere the Group has an obligation to purchase its own shares.Financial instrumentsFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in theCompany balance sheet when the Company becomes party tothecontractual provisions of the instrument.ReceivablesReceivables are recognised initially at fair value, and subsequentlyatamortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less anyexpected credit losses.Financial liabilities and equity instrumentsFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are classified accordingtothe substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.Anequity instrument is any contract that evidences a residualinterest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of itsliabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recordedasthe proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.Interest-bearing borrowingsInterest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recognised atfair value and net of attributable transaction costs. Subsequent toinitial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortisedcost with any differences between proceeds and redemption valuebeing recognised in the Company income statement over the periodofthe borrowings on an effective interest basis.PayablesPayables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently atamortised cost using the effective interest rate method.Derivative financial instruments and hedge accountingThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge itsexposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising fromoperating, financing and investing activities. The Company does nothold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.Derivative financial instruments are recognised and stated at fairvalue. Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, anygains or losses on remeasurementare immediately recognised intheCompany income statement. Where derivatives qualify for hedgeaccounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on thenature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged.Fair value hedgingDerivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedgeswhen they hedge the Company’s exposure to changes in the fairvalue of a recognised asset or liability. Changes in the fair value ofderivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges arerecorded in the Company income statement, together with anychanges in the fair value of the hedged item that are attributable tothe hedged risk.Tesco PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2024206.Financial statements\n","\n","--- Contenu de la page : pfd1 ---\n","If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, theadjustment to the carrying amountof a hedged item is amortisedtothe Company income statement over the remainingperiodtomaturity.Cash flow hedgingDerivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedgeswhen they hedge the Company’s exposure to variability incashflowsthat are either attributable to a particular risk associatedwith a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasttransaction. The effective element of any gain or loss fromremeasuring the derivative designated as the hedging instrumentisrecognised directly in the Company statement of comprehensiveincome/(loss) and accumulated in the hedging reserve. Theineffective element is recognised immediately in the Companyincome statement.The associated cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from othercomprehensive income and recognised in the Company incomestatement in the same period or periods during which thehedgedtransaction affects the Company income statement. Theclassification of the effective portion when recognised in theCompany income statement is the same as the classification ofthehedged transaction.Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrumentexpires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifiesforhedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain orloss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained intheCompany statement of changes in equity until the forecasttransaction occurs or the originalhedged item affects the Companyincome statement. If a forecast hedged transaction isnolongerexpected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised intheCompany statement of changes in equity is reclassified to theCompany income statement.PensionsThe Company participates in a Group defined benefit pensionscheme which is closed to future accrual. The net defined benefitcost and deficit/surplus for the scheme are borne and recognisedby another Group company, TescoStores Limited, as per the statedpolicy of the Group. The Company also participates in a definedcontribution scheme open to all UK employees. Payments to thisscheme are recognised as an expense as they fall due.TaxationCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income forthe financial year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enactedby the balance sheet date.Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method,providing for temporary differences between the carrying amountsof assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and theamounts used for taxation purposes.Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to applyin the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised basedon the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted bythe balance sheet date.The tax expense is recognised in the Company income statement,except when it relates to items recognised directly in the Companystatement of changes in equity or the Company statement ofcomprehensive income/(loss), inwhich case the tax follows thesame treatment.Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probablethat taxable profits will be available against which deductibletemporary differences can be utilised.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset against each otherwhenthere is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assetsagainst current tax liabilities and theyrelate to income taxes leviedby the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity ordifferent taxable entities which intend to settle current tax assetsand liabilities on a netbasis.Pillar Two legislation has been enacted in the UK introducing a globalminimum effective tax rate of 15%. The legislation implements adomestic top-up tax, effective for accounting periods starting on orafter 31 December 2023. The Company has applied the exceptionunder IAS 12 to recognising and disclosing information aboutdeferred tax assets and liabilities related to top-up income taxes.Judgements and sources of estimation uncertaintyThe preparation of the Companyfinancial statements requiresmanagement to make judgements, estimates and assumptionsinapplying the Company’s accounting policies to determine thereported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historicalexperience and various other factors that are believed to bereasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differfromthese estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptionsarereviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions to accountingestimates applied prospectively.The preparation of the Company financial statements for thefinancial year did not require the exercise of any critical accountingjudgements. The Company’s evaluation of the recoverable amountof investments in subsidiaries involves significant estimationuncertainty.

The Group recognised a loss on remeasuring the disposal group to fair value less costs to sell on classification asheld for sale, which triggered an impairmentreview of the Company's investmentin Tesco Personal Finance Group PLC.The recoverable amount was estimated as the equity value of the subsidiary, comprising the value inuse of the money services and insurancebusinesses and fair value less costs to sell of the Banking operations, net of any net debt on the subsidiary balance sheet. The methodologyfor calculating the value in use of money services and insurance isset out in Note 14 of theGroup financial statements. The recoverableamount of the investment is significantly higher thanthe carrying amount and no impairment was recognised.For the other investments in subsidiaries, the key source ofestimation uncertainty in determining the recoverable amount oftradingsubsidiaries is the discount rate. Discount rates are calculated asset out in Note 14 of the Group financial statements.

APMs should be considered in addition to, and are not intendedto be asubstitute for, orsuperior to, IFRS measures.PurposeThe Directors believe that these APMs assist in providing additional useful information on the trends, performance and positionof the Group.APMs aid comparability between geographical units or provide measures that are widely used across the industry. They also aid comparabilitybetween reporting periods; adjusting for certain costs or incomes that derive from events or transactions that fall within the normal activitiesofthe Group but which, by virtue of their sizeor nature, are adjusted, can provideahelpful alternative perspective on year-on-year trends,performance and position that aids comparability over time.The alternative view presented by these APMsis consistent with how management views the business, and how it is reported internally to theBoard and Executive Committee for performance analysis, planning, reporting, decision-making and incentive-setting purposes.Further information on the Group’s adjusting items, which is a critical accounting judgement, can be found in Notes 1 and 4.Some of the Group’s IFRS measures are translated at constant exchange rates. Constant exchange rates are the average actual periodicexchange rates for the previous financial period and are used to eliminate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations in assessingperformance. Actual exchange rates are the average actual periodic exchange rates for that financial period.All income statement measures are presented on a continuing operations basis.Changes to APMsTo align with how management consider property disposals, store buybacks, and properties acquired through business combinations, theDirectors have amended the Retail free cash flow and Capex definitions to exclude store property purchases. These transactionsareexcluded because of their unpredictable or irregular timing.During the financial year, Tesco Bank paida £250m special dividend that represented a one-off return of excess capital from the Bank to theRetail segment. As this is not expectedto recur, management have excluded it from theRetail free cash flow measure, as this best helpscomparability of the Retail segment over time.In addition to the change described above, the Retail free cashflow description and reconciliation has been simplified to listthe investingcash flows that are included in the APM rather than those that are excluded.The Directors have clarified the definition of Net debt in light of Banking operations (withinthe Tesco Bank segment) being classified asdiscontinued. Net debt continues to exclude Tesco Bank. Only Retail continuing and discontinuedoperations are included in Netdebt.The Directors have also removed Net interest margin from the APMs, as it no longer forms partof how management considers the long-termperformance of the business.Group APMsAPMClosest equivalentIFRS measureAdjustments to reconcileto IFRS measureDefinition and purposeIncome statementRevenue measuresSales RevenueFuel salesExcludes the impact of fuel sales made at petrol filling stationsto demonstrate the Group’s performance in the Retail andfinancial services businesses.
