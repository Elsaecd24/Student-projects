The "Assembly of the z-movies.ipynb" notebook is used to assemble 2D images spatially and temporally in order to obtain the 3D time-lapse
image showed in the video "Video Projections of 3d_with_time_heart.mp4".

The "Assembly of the z-movies-LoG.ipynb " notebook is used to assemble 2D images spatially and temporally in order to obtain the 3D time-
lapse image showed in the video "Video Projections of 3d_with_time_heart.mp4". The main difference between this notebook and the one called "Assembly of the z-movies.ipynb" is
that the raw image was processed with a Laplacian of Gaussian filter and the shifts between the z-movies were determined from the processed images (in the first notebook, 
the shifts were determined directly from the raw images).
The assembly with the LoG filter showed better results because the subsequent segmentation counted 310 nuclei, whereas for the assembly without the LoG filter, the segmentation
identified 289 nuclei.

The 3DeeCellTracker notebooks used to segment and track nuclei come from the Github https://github.com/WenChentao/3DeeCellTracker/tree/master. 
Some programs have been added to the notebook "3DeeCellTracker Demo - Single mode Use StarDist.ipynb" compared to Chentao Wen's notebook.

The notebook "Data Analysis.ipynb" was written to analyze the data extracted from segmentation and tracking, specifically to analyze the movement and morphology of nuclei over 
time (several metrics have been proposed). If the results are not satisfactory, another notebook called "Data Analysis-with-MAD.ipynb" has been set up to remove nuclei that 
show anomalies (due to poor segmentation or tracking over time). It uses the Median Absolute Deviation method to identify outliers and exclude them from the calculations.

Graphs using the Plotly library do not display when opening the notebook on GitHub (unlike graphs plotted with Matplotlib). Videos of the graphs related to the programs 
in the "A - Movement of labels over time" section of the "Data Analysis.ipynb" notebook have been captured on video and uploaded to this GitHub (videos "Movement of labels
over time (each label in different color).mp4" and "Movement of labels over time (labels classified).mp4").

If you would like to obtain videos of the 3D trajectory and velocity graphs, please contact me and I will send them to you via transfernow.
